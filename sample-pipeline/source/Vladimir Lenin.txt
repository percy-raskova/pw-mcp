'''Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov'''<ref group="lower-alpha">Russian: Владимир Ильич Ульянов</ref> (22 April 1870 — 21 January 1924), better known as '''Vladimir Lenin''', was a [[Russian Empire (1721–1917)|Russian]] revolutionary leader, [[Political economy|political and economic]] theorist, philosopher and statesman. He was the main leader of the [[Russian revolution of 1917|October Revolution]], which led to the establishment of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1922–1991)|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], the first [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' and peasants' state]].

Lenin's main contribution to [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory was his theory of [[imperialism]], the domination of monopolies and cartels. In many of his works, he also contributed greatly to the development of a Marxist [[praxis]], the strategy and tactics of the [[revolution]], the Marxist theory of [[state]], and the structuring of a proletarian organization through [[democratic centralism]].

Lenin's political and theoretical activity, his writings of the 1890s and the beginning of the 20th century, his resolute struggle against [[opportunism]] and [[Revisionism|revisionist]] attempts to distort Marxist theory, and his struggle for the creation of a revolutionary [[political party]] is considered the [[Leninism|Leninist]] contribution to Marxism, now commonly referred to as [[Marxism–Leninism]].

Lenin was admitted to the Faculty of Law at Kazan University in 13 August 1886, and a month later he joined the Samara-Simbirsk Fraternity, a student society, at the time prohibited by the University Statutes and punishable by expulsion.<ref name="cpsubio1-2" /><ref name="krausz-1-2">{{Citation|author=Tamás Krausz|year=2015|title=Reconstructing Lenin: an intellectual biography|chapter=Who was Lenin?|section=Education|page=|quote=|pdf=|city=|publisher=|isbn=9781583674499|doi=|lg=http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=5946304838C5CEC14E6E116873F3641A|mia=|title-url=|chapter-url=|trans-title=|trans-lang=}}</ref> A year after he began his studies, he joined student campaigns and demonstrations demanding that student socie­ties be permitted, that students who had been expelled be rein­stated and those responsible for their expulsion be called to account.<ref name="cpsubio1-2" /> As a result of participation in the student demonstrations, on December 1887, Lenin was arrested, expelled from University and exiled to a nearby village for one year, becoming under strict police surveillance since then.<ref name="cpsubio1-2" />

Throughout his exile in the village of Kokushkino, Lenin studied extensively [[political economy]] works and other literature. Later in his life, he wrote about this period: “I don't think I ever afterwards read so much in my life, not even during my imprisonment in St. Petersburg or exile in Siberia, as I did in the year when I was banished to the village from Kazan; I read voraciously from early morning till late at night.”<ref name="cpsubio1-2" />

In the autumn of 1888, Lenin was permitted to return to Kazan and shortly after returning, but unable to readmit to the university. He was also prohibited from attending universities abroad. Back in Kazan, he joined a Marxist study-circle organized by Nikolai Fedoseyev, beginning his political and revolutionary activities. It was during this period of 1888–89 that Lenin studied for the first time [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Capital, vol. I]].<ref name="cpsubio1-2" />

In May 1889, the Ulyanov family moved to a village next to the city of Samara, with Lenin narrowly escaping another arrest by the secret police, which arrested and imprisoned members of Fedoseyev [[Marxism|Marxist]] study circles of Kazan a month later. In Samara, Lenin earned a living by giving lessons. Considering he was prohibited from attending university, Lenin sent several applications requesting permission to pass his university examinations without attending lectures, until 1890, when he received the permission to do so, along with the task of studying for 18 months independently. After hard work and intense study schedule, he took his examinations in 1891, achieving the highest marks in all subjects, receiving a first-class diploma.<ref name="cpsubio1-3">{{Citation|author=Pyotr Pospelov & Institute of Marxism-Leninism|year=1965|title=Lenin: a biography|chapter=Childhood and youth.

Lenin began to practice law in the Samara Regional Court, and he appeared for defense in court about twenty times during the period of 1892–93. His legal practice, however, was secondary only to diligently studying Marxism to prepare himself for revolutionary work. In 1892, Lenin organized the first Marxist circle in Samara. The study group focused on the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], the works of [[Plekhanov]] and others.<ref name="cpsubio1-3" /> Lenin's legal practice enriched his knowledge of the real world, as this enabled him to see concrete examples of class struggle from the perspective of the economically disenfranchised and the limits of the bourgeois law apparatus.<ref name="krausz-1-2" />

In 1893, Lenin wrote his earliest theoretical work titled ''New economic developments in peasant life'',<ref group="lower-alpha">The article is available on [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1893/ned/index.htm Marxists Internet Archive].</ref> an analysis of Russia's economy based on data and statistics on [[Peasantry|peasant]] farming.<ref name="cpsubio1-3" /> During that time, Lenin corresponded with Nikolai Fedoseyev and exchanged views on Marxist theory and the economic and political developments of Russia.<ref name="cpsubio1-3" /> He had a deep affection for their friendship, and years later he wrote: "Fedoseyev played a very important role in the Volga area and in certain parts of Central Russia during that period; and the turn towards Marxism at that time was, undoubtedly, very largely due to the influence of this exceptionally talented and exceptionally devoted revolutionary."<ref>{{Citation|author=Vladimir Lenin|year=1922|title=A few words about N.

The idea of creating of a single, united Marxist party in Russia occupied a central place in Lenin's writings at the time of his exile in Siberia. Lenin wrote three articles for the ''Workers' Gazette'',<ref group="lower-alpha">Russian: Рабочая Газета</ref> which had been adopted as the official newspaper organ of the RSDLP, on the question of founding a Marxist party, ''Our programme,<ref>{{Citation|author=Vladimir Lenin|year=1899|title=Our programme|chapter=|section=|page=|quote=It made clear the real task of a revolutionary socialist party: not to draw up plans for refashioning society, not to preach to the capitalists and their hangers-on about improving the lot of the workers, not to hatch conspiracies, but to organize the class struggle of the proletariat and to lead this struggle, the ultimate aim of which is the conquest of political power by the proletariat and the organization of a socialist society.|pdf=|city=|publisher=|isbn=|doi=|lg=|mia=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1899/articles/arg2op.htm|title-url=|chapter-url=|trans-title=|trans-lang=}}</ref> Our immediate task,''<ref>{{Citation|author=Vladimir Lenin|year=1899|title=Our immediate task|chapter=|section=|page=|quote=It is the task of the Social-Democrats, by organizing the workers, by conducting propaganda and agitation among them, to turn their spontaneous struggle against their oppressors into the struggle of the whole class, into the struggle of a definite political party for definite political and socialist ideals.

The conditions essential to such a step already exist: local Party work is being carried on and obviously has struck deep roots; for the destructive police attacks that are growing more frequent lead to only short interruptions; fresh forces rapidly replace those that have fallen in battle. The Party has resources for publishing and literary forces, not only abroad, but in Russia as well.

In the summer of 1900, Lenin discussed with Plekhanov the publication of Iskra, to which Plekhanov demanded a privileged position on the editorial board and this triggered a heated debate with Lenin to the point his relationship with Plekhanov became severely strained.<ref name="cpsubio-married22222">{{Citation|author=Pyotr Pospelov & Institute of Marxism-Leninism|year=1965|title=Lenin: a biography|chapter=For a proletarian party of a new type|section=Preparations for founding an all-Russia newspaper|page=69|quote=Plekhanov, like the other members of his group, approved the idea of such Marxist periodi­cals. But he considered himself entitled to a privileged position on the editorial board, and his arrogance was such as to exclude the possibility of normal collective work. Lenin, who stood always for collective effort, could not accept this stand. The programme of the newspaper and magazine and the problems of publication and of joint editorial work were discussed at conferences held in Belrive and Corsier (near Geneva). The disagreement with Plekhanov came out with particular force during the conference at Corsier, attended by Lenin, Plekhanov, Zasulich, Axelrod and Potresov.

From this condition emerges the task which the Russian Social-Democracy is called upon to fulfill — to imbue the masses of the proletariat with the ideas of socialism and political consciousness, and to organize a revolutionary party inseparably connected with the spontaneous working-class movement.

During the period of 1901–1902, the editorial board of the Iskra was drafting a programme for the RSDLP in preparation for the Second Congress of the party. Sharp ideological differences between Plekhanov and Lenin arose, and they wrote different drafts for the programme, which was later united into a single programme by a dedicated committee. Most notably, Lenin insisted on advocating the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] as an essential condition of the revolution in the party programme.<ref name="cpsubio-married22222322">{{Citation|author=Pyotr Pospelov & Institute of Marxism-Leninism|year=1965|title=Lenin: a biography|chapter=For a proletarian party of a new type|section=The spark will kindle a flame|page=79-80|quote=In January 1902, Lenin presented critical remarks on Plekhanov's draft.

Further, the second draft omitted "reference to the dictatorship of the proletariat"; it failed to stress the leading role of the working class as the only truly revolutionary class ; it spoke, not of the class struggle of the proletariat, but of the common struggle of all the toiling and exploited; it did not sufficiently bring out the proletarian nature of the Party.|pdf=|city=Moscow|publisher=Progress Publishers, CC CPSU|isbn=|doi=|lg=http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=EB243CBDFE643F26EEB1360F866F261F|mia=|title-url=|chapter-url=|trans-title=|trans-lang=}}</ref> In 1902, Lenin published his famous work, ''[[Library:What is to be done?|What is to be done?]]'', presenting a thorough analysis of the international opportunist trends in social-democratic organizations of Europe.<ref name="cpsubio-married222223222">{{Citation|author=Pyotr Pospelov & Institute of Marxism-Leninism|year=1965|title=Lenin: a biography|chapter=For a proletarian party of a new type|section=What is to be done?|page=83|quote=Disclosing the international nature of opportunism, Lenin showed that, while assuming different forms in different countries, in its content opportunism remained everywhere the same.

== Initial struggles against Menshevik opportunism inside the RSDLP (1903–1905) ==
After having their positions defeated at the Second Congress in 1903, the newly-formed opportunist Menshevik faction frequently disregarded the congress decisions, sabotaged party work, and began to attempt to gain control of the party's central bodies. Having sided with the Mensheviks, Plekhanov co-opted to the editorial board of Iskra all of its former editors, disregarding the congress resolutions.

In March 1917, Lenin called for the liberation of all [[Colonialism|colonized]] and oppressed nations.<ref>{{Citation|author=Stephen Gowans|year=2018|title=Patriots, Traitors and Empires: The Story of Korea’s Struggle for Freedom|chapter=The Empire of Japan|page=38|pdf=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4iiga4ngtxusr2civjxewbili5jne2sbpefbx2s3im2kphattzc?filename=Stephen%20Gowans%20-%20Patriots%2C%20Traitors%20and%20Empires_%20The%20Story%20of%20Korea%E2%80%99s%20Struggle%20for%20Freedom-Baraka%20Books%20%282018%29.pdf|city=Montreal|publisher=Baraka Books|isbn=9781771861427|lg=https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=8435F6FF91279531705764823FDC2A7F}}</ref> In April, he published the [[April Theses]], which denounced the [[First World War|Great War]] and called for another revolution to overthrow the [[Russian provisional government|provisional government]] and establish a [[soviet republic]] and [[Communist International (1919–1943)|Third International]].<ref>{{Citation|author=[[Vijay Prashad]]|year=2017|title=Red Star over the Third World|chapter=Red October|page=28–29|pdf=https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecu7gb2ei65us6ip3r2ugcgkblneqcftbm456mb6bzvprkbqk55qm?filename=Vijay%20Prashad%20-%20Red%20Star%20Over%20the%20Third%20World-LeftWord%20Books%20%282018%29.pdf|city=New Delhi|publisher=LeftWord Books}}</ref>

In June 1920, Lenin met with two [[Empire of Japan (1868–1947)|Japanese]] journalists: [[K. Fussa]] and [[M. Nakahira]]. He asked them questions about Japanese history and society. He was happy when he learned that corporal punishment of children was rare in Japan, as the Soviet government had banned it three years earlier.<ref>{{Citation|author=[[Vijay Prashad]]|year=2017|title=Red Star over the Third World|chapter=Eastern Graves|page=16–17|pdf=https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecu7gb2ei65us6ip3r2ugcgkblneqcftbm456mb6bzvprkbqk55qm?filename=Vijay%20Prashad%20-%20Red%20Star%20Over%20the%20Third%20World-LeftWord%20Books%20%282018%29.pdf|city=New Delhi|publisher=LeftWord Books}}</ref>

== Declining health and death (1923–1924) ==
Lenin suffered his first stroke in May 1922 and another in December. Following the second stroke, his doctors tried to isolate him from politics because they feared it could cause another attack. Lenin's state worsened in February 1923 and he became unable to work.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|author=Ludo Martens|year=1996|title=Another View of Stalin|chapter=The young Stalin forges his arms|isbn=9782872620814|publisher=Editions EPO|pdf=https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceab64vxtxpqt2cdl4zsrsftmedqidn4foq74gr25qkd35z5nwogdi?filename=Ludo%20Martens%20-%20Another%20View%20of%20Stalin-Editions%20EPO%20%281996%29.pdf|page=21–25}}</ref>

=== Lenin's 'will' ===
Lenin composed his last writing in late December 1922 with a postscript from January 1923. [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] claim that this was Lenin's 'will', but [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] himself admitted in 1925 that there had never been a will.

The document called for increasing the number of Central Committee members from 50 to 100 in order to prevent a split in the party. It also evaluated five party leaders: [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], Trotsky, [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]], and [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]]. Lenin criticized Trotsky for being bureaucratic and egocentric and said that Bukharin did not fully understand [[dialectics]]. He accused Zinoviev and Kamenev of treason during the October Revolution. The postscript criticized Stalin for being rude to Krupskaya.<ref name=":0" />
