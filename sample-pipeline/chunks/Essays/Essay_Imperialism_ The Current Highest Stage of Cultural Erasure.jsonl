was, in part,\nan item encouraged or imposed by Spanish norms of modesty.\nYet, P'urhepecha women took this garment\nand made it a canvas for their identity\nthrough specific weaving techniques, colors, and ways of wearing it.\nA long, shawl-like garment\nwas present in the colonial context\nsince 1572\n(from Indigenous, Spanish, and Asian likely Philippines influences).\nThe P'urhepecha people took this item\nand transformed it\nthrough their own weaving techniques,\nartistic vision, and cultural practices\ninto something that is now a definitive symbol of their identity.\n\nA similar thing happened to the Roma\nwith the diklo,\na garment worn on married Romani women's heads.\nThey took this common,\ngeneric item\nand imposed their own distinct cultural rules, meanings, and identity onto it.\nIt has become just as much an icon of Romani woman identity\nas the kuanintikua\nhas become the icon of P'urhepecha woman identity.\n\nDespite the postcolonial origins,\nthe linguistic existence of 'kuanintikua' speaks to the P'urhepechaness of the garment;\nlikewise, the term 'diklo' couldn't have existed either until the garment was created.\nSo language also evolved with their material existence.\nIt didn't necessarily have to be at least 400 years old\nto be validly traditional.\n\nAnd when we think about the Romani creation\nof the word diklo...\nThe Roma didn't just use the Hungarian, Russian, or Spanish word for \"headscarf.\"\nThey created their own term\nfrom their own Romani chib.\nThis act of naming and design\ntransforms a generic item\ninto a culturally specific artifact.\nSo despite the pressures exerted by their European overlords,\nthe language evolved in a way that wasn't dilution,\nbut a fortification.\n\nWhat can my Roma side\nteach my P'urhe side\nabout what is the indigenous original core?\nIt teaches me that the core is not a static list\nof pre-contact items\nthat can never change,\nand that even a diverse and landless people\ncan continue to thrive.\nThe heart of a culture\nis a living, generative process.\nThe problem is when this generative process\nis found to be breaking down.\nThe core giving away to something else.\nThe core is the foundation,\nthe fundamental building blocks, the DNA,\nthat can be rearranged\ninto infinite forms (genres)\nwhile remaining unmistakably P'urhepecha or Romani.\n\nPeople say language is all we need to survive as a people.\nBut, while language is foundational,\nit's not even the bare minimum.\nYou can have people speaking P'urhepecha\nwhile singing cumbia tunes with Spanish-language structures.\nThe language is saved,\nbut a certain cultural essence\nis still lost.\nTherefore,\nactive cultivation of all the rest\nis also necessary.\n\nIt's about what we pour our language into.\nThe Romani language has survived not just because people spoke it,\nbut because they used it to sing their specific music,\nto tell their specific stories,\nand to uphold their specific laws (Romanipen).\nThe language was the vessel,\nbut the cultural content was the precious cargo that gave the journey purpose.\nThe remaining Roma who lost the language\nstill carry a lot of the cultural 'cargo',\nand this brings them to want to learn it again.\n\nFor a thousand years,\nwithout a land,\na state, an army, or a central authority,\nfacing relentless persecution,\nthe Roma have maintained their core.\nThey have done it\nthrough the uncompromising,\ncollective choice\nto prioritize their own essence in everyday life...\n\nMan,\nif the Roma can do it and not even have a LAND,\nand if they can resist for not 400 but 1000 years...\nthen so what excuse do we P'urhepecha even have?\nWho do we have to blame but ourselves\nif people's everyday choices\nare towards Mexican cultural nationalism\nwhen our own grandparents or great grandparents\ndidn't even consider themselves\nMexican let alone hispanic/latino/etc?\nYou can hear it in the music the people play,\nthe American clothing that almost never changes\nfor our traditional xukuparhakua,\nthe choice to speak Spanish\nand reject the language of our parents.\nSome elders feel that the youth are the problem,\nand they aren't entirely wrong:\nby and large,\nit's the youth who are assimilating.\nIt's enough to make an old P'urhepecha man very grumpy.\n\nOur Greatest Enemy\nYet The cultures I am talking about\nare thousands of years old\nand most likely pre-existed class society.\nIf we don't practice our culture\nin our daily lives and everyday habits,\nthen it will die out,\nand what comes
