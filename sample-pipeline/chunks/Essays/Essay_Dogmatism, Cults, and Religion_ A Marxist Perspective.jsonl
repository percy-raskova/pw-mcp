Tendency.\nAs such with any essay,\nan essay exists within the confines of a particular person (or persons)\nwhich shows their particular experience.\nBack in 2022,\nI was only on the stepping stone\nto truly understanding theory, dogmatism, and ideology.\n\nAside from grammatical and spelling issues,\nthe essay primarily focused on analysing dogmatism\nwithin the context of Marxism,\nsuch that it completely abstracted\nfrom the confines of dogmatism in general.\nThis dogmatism,\nwhich is prevalent in religious organisations, cults, etc.\nmust also be taken into account.\nOne grave error a Marxist can do is abstract information\nrather than apply the information\nto a specific context.\n\nAs such the three characteristics I've given in regards to dogmatism,\nthat being;\n\n# regarding statements as 'fact' without evidence,\n# utilising a false premise\nin order to justify their statement,\n# and (typically but not always) striving\nfor purity fetishism,\n\nare incomplete analyses\nthat require further work.\nTherefore,\nthis essay will analyse dogmatism in general.\nWithin the context of ideology,\nnot just Marxism.\nTherefore this essay\nserves as perhaps as an extension of my previous essay,\nthough I do not recommend reading my previous essay,\nas I will begin to analyse from scratch.\n\nWhy Do We Need to Analyse Dogmatism?\nDogmatism,\nas it exists within the context of Marxism,\nis indeed vehemently opposed.\nHowever this dogmatism,\nhowever it exists,\nit certainly does not exist within Marxism alone.\nIt exists within other ideologies,\nwithin pseudoscience,\nconspiracy theories, cults, and organised religion.\nThis dogmatism,\nof which I will touch on,\ndoes not only talk about dogmatism,\nbut also talk about those who call a particular group dogmatic.\n\nTo begin,\nwe will not look at dogmatism.\nBut why?\nIsn't that what this essay is about?\nThe issue at hand\nis that dogmatism isn't a nuclear unit.\nIt is divisible,\nit is a process.\nA process which transformed due to human need of productivity.\nTo look at dogmatism at face value\nis to make an incorrect analysis.\nThis is a mistake\nwhich I made earlier.\nI looked at dogmatism\nwithin the context of human society,\nstarting with pre-class society.\nHowever we must begin in a different standpoint,\nwith a model that can accurately define dogmatism\nfrom the perspectives\nthat exist within capitalist society today.\n\nFacts and Truth\nThe existence of a truth\nis something\nwhich concerns philosophers, scientists, and practically anyone who possesses a rational mind\nin today's world.\nCapitalists see some sort of \"truth\"\nwithin its system,\nMarxists see some sort of \"truth\"\nwithin its socialist framework.\nWhat differentiates the Capitalists and Marxists in this case?\n\nThe search for truth\nis within the groundwork of idealism and materialism.\nThe division between materialism and idealism\nshould then be considered\nin order to find a specific \"truth\"\nwhich can be considered a truth.\nAs a marxist,\nwe side with materialism,\nto be specific,\ndialectical materialism.\nDiamat as it will be shortened from now on,\nlays a framework and a model of which we consider it to be a superior model\nto mechanical (metaphysical) materialism,\nand idealism consequently.\n\nWhichever is more right will matter less as this essay continues,\nnot because of them being less distinct,\nbut rather within the application of a \"truth\" being used in the context of society.\nUnder marxism,\nthe criterion of truth\nexists within the context of reality.\nThis reality,\nwhich exists independently of our consciousness,\nmeans that there exists truth\nwhich cannot be observed\nby using our body alone\n(e.g. the eye cannot see germs or microbes).\n\nThus we can reason our understandings\nof a \"truth\",\nand the criterion of truth.\nTruth can be understood as something which exists that proves something.\nSo through truth,\nwe can negate it, an untruth, or falsity.\nFalsity can be understood as the reverse of Truth.\nAs such,\nthe criterion of truth\nis our interpretation\nwhich solidifies Truth.\nAlthough truth exists,\nthe criterion of truth\ndictates the truth in question.\nThe truth cannot exist without the criterion,\nand the criterion cannot exist without the truth.\nThough they sound opposites,\ngiven that criterion is our interpretation of a truth\nwhich should be objective,\nmaking it subjective,\nthey exist in a link,\na relationship.", "article_title": "Essay Dogmatism, Cults, and Religion  A
