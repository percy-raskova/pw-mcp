{"chunk_id": "Main/Imperialism#0", "text": "thumb|World map with imperialist countries in blue Imperialism\nis the most recent evolution\nof the capitalist mode of production\nthat began in the late 1800s to early 1900s,\nin which monopolies and cartels\nbecome the dominant economic force of society.\nIt involves the merger of banking capital\nwith industrial capital\nto create the greater finance capital\nand a fundamental distinguishing character of export of capital\ninstead of export of commodities.\n\nIt is a global system\nof economic, political, and military domination,\nwith the imperialist powers\nusing a variety of means,\nincluding economic sanctions, military interventions,\nand cultural influence\nto maintain their dominance over other nations.\n\nLenin synthesized a Marxist analysis of imperialism\nin his pamphlet Imperialism:\nThe Highest Stage of Capitalism in 1916,\nexpanding on the foundation\nof the earlier work of John A. Hobson entitled Imperialism: A Study.\nLenin wrote that rapid growth of industry\nand concentration of production\nin growing enterprises\nrepresent the key characteristic of capitalism.\n\nMultiple theorists\nhave updated,\ndeepened,\ndeveloped or critically engaged\nwith the classical analysis of Imperialism.\nFor example,\nKwame Nkrumah,\nwho wrote Neocolonialism,\nthe Last Stage of Imperialism.\nMost recently,\nthe concept of neoimperialism\nhas emerged\nin the work of Cheng Enfu.\n\nThe development of imperialism\nin the global economy\nalso reinforces a dialectical relationship\nbetween core-periphery countries,\nmainly dependency and subordination\nof underdeveloped countries\nto imperialist economies.\nIn conjunction with these developments,\nnew theoretical models\nwere proposed to understand developments,\nsuch as dependency theory and world-systems theory.\n\nImperialism is inevitable under Capitalism\nbecause Capitalism is based on the premise of infinite growth\nin a finite system.\nWhen capitalists first run into the limits of their own country,\nthey will eventually be forced to expand their markets, resources, and influence\ninto other countries and territories\nin order to continue increasing their profits.\nNot only that, but the tendency of the rate of profit\nto fall ensures\nthat with their own market's profit yields\nare bound to decrease and in order to offset that,\noutwards expansionism\nand conquest of foreign markets\nbecomes a material necessity rather than whim.\n\nFurthermore,\nthe capitalists can exploit\nand oppress the workers of other nations\nmuch more easily\nthan they can in their own.\nFor example,\nby moving manufacturing jobs\nfrom the imperialist countries\nto the imperialized countries\nwhere wages are lower,\nand environmental protections\nand labour rights\nare much weaker -- if they exist at all --\nthey can reduce costs\nwhich increases profits.\n\nWhen the capitalists run into limits again,\nand are unable to continue increasing their profits --\neven by exploiting the periphery --\nthey will inevitably turn Imperialism inwards\nand further oppress and exploit workers domestically.\nThis is the origin of Fascism.\n\nMistranslation\nof \"highest stage\"\nIn his book on Imperialism,\nLenin is often translated as having said that imperialism\nis \"the highest stage\" of capitalism.\nIn the original Russian version,\nLenin is stating that imperialism is the 'latest' or 'most recent' or contemporary stage,\nrather than definitively saying that it is the final stage.\n\nTheoretical overview\nIn Vladimir Lenin's further analysis of imperialism,\nthis economic stage is defined by five basic features:\n* The presence of monopolies\nwhich play a decisive role in economic life.\n* The merging of bank capital\nwith industrial capital\ninto finance capital\ncontrolled by a financial oligarchy.\n* The export of capital\nas distinguished from the simple export of commodities.\n* The formation of international monopolist capitalist associations (cartels)\nand multinational corporations.\n* The domination and exploitation of other countries\nby militaristic imperialist powers,\nnow through neocolonialism.\n* The territorial division of the whole world\namong the biggest capitalist powers.\nThis expansion to Marx's analysis of capitalist development\nwas one of Lenin's most important theoretical contributions to political economy.\nMarx posited that as capitalist economies matured,\nthey would inevitably be driven into a crisis\nwhich would result in internal class revolt\nand the establishment of a dictatorship\nof the proletariat (and eventually socialism).\nHowever,\naccording to Lenin's observations,\nthe development of imperialism\nallowed capitalism\nto postpone this crisis\nthrough the acquisition of colonies,\nwhich served as a new outlets for capital investment\nand a new source of labour power to exploit.\n\nThis scramble for the expansion of capitalist empires\ndrove the various imperialist powers\ninto a competition with one another\nover the size of their imperialist spheres of influence\nand access to resources and labour markets,\nwhich led to destructive inter-imperialist conflicts\nsuch as the First World War.\nImperialism thus stretches the inherent contradictions of capitalism\nto ever more extreme limits,\nleading J.V. Stalin to deem Leninism\nthe \"Marxism of the era of imperialism\".", "article_title": "Imperialism", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 0, "line_range": "1-148", "word_count": 766, "categories": ["Marxist terminology", "Marxist theory", "Marxism", "Leninism", "Capitalism", "Debunking myths"], "internal_links": ["capitalist", "mode of production", "Monopoly", "Cartel", "Vladimir Lenin", "capital", "Commodity", "Vladimir Lenin", "Marxism", "J.

{"chunk_id": "Main/Imperialism#1", "text": "Imperialism\nas a stage of development in capitalism\nmeans that it will always develop\nin any sufficiently advanced capitalist mode of production.\nAs markets become saturated\nwithin the boundaries of the individual nation\n(due to an influx of producers),\ncapital must be exported elsewhere,\nand the main function of banks\nis to help with that (see finance capitalism).\n\nCapitalist countries\nmust eventually turn to imperialism\nfor two main reasons:\n#Capitalism requires constant consumption,\nwhich translates into constant growth (and GDP growth).\nWithout GDP growth,\ncapitalism stagnates\nand a recession occurs.\nHowever,\nsince it is impossible\nto expect infinite growth\nwith finite available resources\nand as markets become saturated,\nthe bourgeoisie must seek new opportunities.\n#The bourgeoisie\nis also in constant internal competition,\nand as such there is a very rational reason\nfor a capitalist\nto emerge victorious\nover the competition;\naccessing untapped markets\nand cheaper labour\nwill give them an edge over the competition.\nHowever,\nimperialized countries\nwill not be allowed to develop past the most primitive stage of capitalism,\npreventing them from developing their own imperialism.\nIn these countries,\nwe may see the emergence of two distinct subsections of the bourgeoisie.\nFirstly,\na \"comprador\" class,\ni.e.\nthe section of the national bourgeoisie\nwhich is allied with,\nand dependent upon,\nforeign imperialist investment;\nand second,\nthe \"national\" bourgeoisie,\nwhose class interests are, at least temporarily,\naligned with the exploited working class:\nto achieve national liberation\n(so that they can become exploiters\nwithout being exploited,\nupon which point their tentative alignment\nwith the national proletariat\nwill end).\n\nOrigins and historical development thumb|\nMost modern imperialist countries\noriginated\nas [[Genocide|genocidal colonial powers]]\nThe development of imperialism\nbegan with the Panic of 1873,\nwhich caused an economic depression\nlasting through the 1880s.\nWhen the economy recovered in 1889,\ncartels took advantage of the situation\nand drove up prices.\nAfter another depression from 1900 to 1903,\nthey became even stronger\nand controlled the coal, mining, and iron industries by 1905.\nNot all are combat-ready troops.\nThe numbers of these U.S. personnel in some particular countries\nis as follows:\n\n* Germany: 36,000 * Italy: 12,000 * Britain: 9,000 * Spain: 3,000 * Turkey: 1,600\n\nBesides these personnel,\nthe U.S. rotates 4,500 troops through Poland.\n\nMyths Soviet \"imperialism\"\nDuring the Cold War,\na rivalry\nbetween the world's two global powers at the time (the USA and the Soviet Union),\nthe CIA's Congress for Cultural Freedom\ncultivated a milieu\nof anti-Soviet leftists\nto advance the geopolitical line of the US.\nOne accusation that was leveled against the Soviet Union\nwas that it was yet another imperialist state,\nbased on the conflicts\nwhich happened between the Soviet Union and China.\nUSSR did not practice imperialism\nin the Leninist sense —\nit did not export capital\nand was not under control\nof a financial oligarchy.\n\nChinese \"imperialism\"\nIn modern times,\nsome accuse China\nof being imperialist,\nmainly in Africa.\nThese people again use the liberal definition of imperialism\nand can be ignored in much the same way.\n\nWith its Belt and Road Initiative,\nChina does not practice the same harsh policies\nas the IMF\n(namely, forcing austerity upon loan recipients)\nand that is why they are being favored by more and more countries,\nleading to a disinformation campaign\nby the imperial core\nto help drive popular support\nfrom the B&R and back towards the IMF.\nFamously,\nChinese loans pay for infrastructure (needed for development),\nare often forgiven\nand restructured,\nand there are no policies required to get such a loan.\nWhere the West builds economic dependency\nthe PRC builds mutual economic cooperation.\n<blockquote>\nIf any debtors encounter difficulties to pay on time,\nthere may be tailored plans\nincluding rescheduling…\nadding grants\nto help bring projects back to life,\nconducting debt-equity swaps,\nor hiring Chinese firms\nto assist operations.\nJust like repairing and enhancing a patient’s hemopoietic system,\nadopting such measures\nto help the projects get back on track\nand gain profit\nhas advantages\nover simply offering write-offs\nwhich may only solve issues on the surface\nand are unsustainable</blockquote>\nMoreover,\nunlike the IMF and Western international financial institutions\nthe PRC does not enforce austerity upon nations\nwith heavy debt to it.\nInstead only conditioning it on political recognition\nof the Chinese state\nrather than the forward base\nof Western Imperialism\nin East Asia, Taiwan.\n<blockquote>...\nChina has not applied the kinds of highly contested economic austerity\nand structural adjustment conditions\nimposed by the HIPC\n(Heavily Indebted Poor Countries)  process.\nYet,\nthere is always one political condition:\ncountries need to have diplomatic relations with Beijing (instead of Taipei).", "article_title": "Imperialism", "namespace": "Main",
