century German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary\nwho, alongside his friend and long-time collaborator Friedrich Engels,\ndiscovered the laws of development of human societies\nbased on the dialectical materialist method\nand in doing so creating Marxism.\n\nMarx\nis the most important thinker of the communist movement.\nHe highlighted the contradictions and intrinsic exploitation in capitalism,\nand helped develop socialist economic models.\nHis most famous works,\nthe Communist Manifesto,\nwhich he co-wrote with Engels in 1848,\nand Capital,\nthe first volume of which was completed in 1867,\nhave had enormous international influence.\n\nLife Early life Marx was born May 5, 1818\nin the small rural town of Trier,\nin the south of Rhenish Prussia,\nin what is today Germany,\nclosely bordering France.\nAt the time, Trier had about 11 thousand residents,\nand from 1794 to 1815,\nthe city belonged to France,\nwhich changed after Napoleon's defeat\nand Prussian annexation of the region.\nHe was the third child of Heinrich and Henriette Marx,\ngrowing up with seven siblings.\nBy 1847, at the age of 29,\nmost of them would have died of tuberculosis,\nexcept his three sisters\nwho eventually outlived him: Sophie (1816 – 1886),\nEmilie (1822 – 1888) and Louise (1821 – 1893).\n\nThe family of Karl Marx\nbelonged to a prosperous petty bourgeoisie of Trier,\nand he had Jewish origins\nboth from his mother and father,\nbut his family converted to Protestant Christianity in 1824.\nKarl's father Heinrich was a well-to-do lawyer\nwhich had a good reputation\namong the upper strata of society in Trier,\nand had accumulated a certain level of wealth.\n\nKarl Marx and his sister Sophie\nbecame acquainted with Edgar and Jenny von Westphalen,\nwho later became Marx's wife.\nThis friendship began either through Karl and Edgar,\nwho studied at the same school,\nor through a friendship between their fathers.\nThe von Westphalen family was also a petty bourgeois family.\nThe young Karl had a friendship\nwith the baron Johann Ludwig von Westphalen, Jenny's father,\nand he became an influence on Marx\nthrough their intellectual exchange.\n\nFrom 1830 to 1835,\nMarx studied on the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium,\na public secondary education school\nwhich prepared students to university.\nThere, he studied with several teachers,\nsome of them critical of the political state of things\nincluding Johann Hugo Wyttenbach,\nthe school director.\nAt the time,\nliberalism was associated with revolutionary ideals\nand a romantic sentiment\ntowards the French Revolution,\nboth of which was frowned upon by the Prussian government.\nAt Trier Gymnasium\nMarx studied the Greek, Latin and French languages.\nMarx's father\nwas not satisfied\nwith the level of quality Bonn\noffered in areas of natural science\nand persuaded him to transfer to the University of Berlin,\nat the time\na well-established\nand highly respected university.\nThere, he studied Law,\nmajoring in History and Philosophy\nand concluded his university course in 1841,\nsubmitting a doctoral thesis\non the philosophy of Epicurus.\nAt the time Marx was a Hegelian idealist\nin his views\nand belonged to the circle of “Left Hegelians”,\nalong with Bruno Bauer and others.\n\nEarly Journalism\nAfter his graduation from Berlin university,\nMarx was hoping to become a professor at Bonn,\nwhich he eventually lost interest in after witnessing how the reactionary Berlin government deprived Bruno Bauer,\na friend of Marx,\nof his position in Bonn university.\nMarx,\nthrough seeing the battle and struggle\nbetween the growing anti-feudal movement\nand reactionary Prussian government\ndecided to take part in the most important field of battle\nbetween progress and the reactionary forces,\nthat of a political journalist.\n\nIn 1842,\nMarx who by this point\nhad expressed criticism\ntowards the Prussian government's censorship several times,\nalongside Bruno Bauer,\nwas offered to be chief contributor\nof an opposition newspaper\nfounded in Cologne\nnamed Rheinische Zeitung,\nwhich he would become editor-in-chief of in the October of 1842.\nUnder Marx's editorship,\nthe revolutionary-democratic properties of the newspaper\nwere highlighted more and more which at first caused its censorship\nand later its suppression\nby the Prussian government in the January of 1843.\nEven after Marx's attempt to save the paper\nwith his resignation,\nthe pressure from the reactionary Prussian state\ndid not stop\nand eventually resulted in the newspapers suspension in march of 1843.", "article_title": "Karl Marx", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 0, "line_range": "1-128",
