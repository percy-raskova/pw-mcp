Cheng Enfu]]\nSocialism\nis a mode of production\nand transitional phase\nbetween two other modes of production,\ncapitalism and communism,\ncharacterized by workers' management of the means of production\nturned into public property,\nachieved through the expropriation of the bourgeoisie\nby a dictatorship of the proletariat.\nSocialist economies are based on central economic planning,\nabsence of the profit-motive and collectivization.\n\nThe scientific socialist definition of the term,\nas used by Marxist–Leninists,\nrefers to a particular stage of historical development\n—\nspecifically the transitional state\nbetween the capitalist and communist modes of production\n(for this reason,\nit is also known as \"the lower stage of communism\",\nalthough it is generally considered distinct enough from communism\nto constitute its own separate mode of production).\nHowever,\nthe term \"socialism\"\nis often misused\nin broader left-wing discourse\nto denote public works,\nwelfare programmes and/or small-scale forms of economic planning\npracticed by capitalist countries.\n\nAmong the first successful experiments\nin the scientific development of socialist economics\nwas the Soviet Union\nin the late 1920s,\nwhen the the means of production\nwere brought under social ownership,\nnamely the land and agricultural economy\nwas brought under the ownership of the state\nand expropriated\nfrom private landowners called kulaks.\n\nSocialism\ncan be summarized by the motto \"From each according to their ability,\nto each according to their work.\n\"\n\nMeans of production Industry Socialist industry\nis highly concentrated\nand technically advanced\nand based on public ownership.\nEconomic concentration is planned to benefit the entire population.\n\nAgriculture Socialist agriculture\norganizes the scattered peasant economy\ninto large-scale collective and state farms.\nIt is highly mechanized\nand uses machinery\nsuch as tractors and grain harvesters.\n\nPersonal property,\nitems that are relevant to private usage,\nexists in socialism and communism.\n\nIn China,\nfor example,\nthe financial system, energy, oil, insurance, education and aerospace sectors\nare all under strong government control,\nwith state-owned enterprises\ndirecting the majority of these sectors' resources and manpower\nin accordance with China's various 5-year plans.\n\nAt the same time,\nthere are large privately-owned, capitalist enterprises,\nsuch as in the real estate industry.\nThese are kept on a tight leash,\npreventing them from being able to turn their economic power\ninto political power.\nThus we see the characteristics of both.\nThese two contradictory halves\nebb and flow\nwith the aggregate effect being a country\nwhose socialist economy\nhas grown 2-3 times faster than the capitalist USA\nfor the past 30 years.\n\nSocialism\nas the first phase of communism <blockquote>\nBut the scientific difference between Socialism and Communism is clear.\nWhat is usually called Socialism was termed by Marx\nthe \"first\" or lower phase of communist society.\n</blockquote>Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution\ndevelops Marx's analysis\nin Critique of the Gotha Program\nof not only\nin how a socialist society would function\nbut he also attacks the misconception\nthat under socialism,\nworkers will receive the full extent of his or her labour.\nIn Lenin's analysis and interpretation,\nhe maintains that Marxists are not utopians\nwho would assume that wealth inequality\nwould vanish overnight in a socialist society.\nHe makes it clear\nthat as a socialist society is:\n<blockquote>A society\nwhich has just emerged\ninto the light of day\nout of the womb of capitalism\nand which, in every respect,\nbears the birthmarks\nof the old society</blockquote>\nAs such,\nsocialism is marked as the first phase of communism.\nIn this phase,\nthe differences and injustice in wealth\nwill still exist\nbut makes it clear\nwhat will disappear\nis the ability for one person to exploit another\ndue to their inability\nto seize the means of production\nby the conversion of private property\ninto common property.\nThis in turn is directly related to abolishing\nof bourgeois right to private property.\nHowever,\nit does not mean that \"bourgeois rights\"\ndisappear as a whole.\nOn the contrary,\nin this first stage,\nthe bourgeoisie\ncontinue to receive certain rights\nrelated to the capacity of regulator (determining factor)\nin the distribution of products\nand the allotment of labour\namong the members of society.", "article_title": "Socialism", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 0, "line_range": "1-139", "word_count": 687, "categories":
