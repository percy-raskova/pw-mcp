state.\n\nLenin's main contribution to Marxist theory\nwas his theory of imperialism,\nthe domination of monopolies and cartels.\nIn many of his works,\nhe also contributed greatly\nto the development of a Marxist praxis,\nthe strategy and tactics of the revolution,\nthe Marxist theory of state,\nand the structuring of a proletarian organization\nthrough democratic centralism.\n\nLenin's political and theoretical activity,\nhis writings of the 1890s\nand the beginning of the 20th century,\nhis resolute struggle\nagainst opportunism\nand revisionist attempts\nto distort Marxist theory,\nand his struggle for the creation of a revolutionary political party\nis considered the Leninist contribution to Marxism,\nnow commonly referred to as Marxism–Leninism.\n\nEarly life (1870–1888)

background.\nAlthough Lenin's father was not a revolutionary himself,\nhe shared progressive views\nand opposed autocracies,\nand both his father and mother\ncontributed greatly with his intellectual upbringing.\nBesides his mother and father,\na big intellectual influence on Lenin\nwas his brother Alexander,\nwho first introduced him to Marxist literature.\n\nLenin's youth and childhood\ncoincided with a reactionary period in Russia,\nwhen civilians were commonly arrested\nfor expressing criticism\nof the czarist regime.\nIn May 1887,\nwhen Lenin was 17 years old,\nhis

students who had been expelled\nbe rein­stated\nand those responsible for their expulsion\nbe called to account.\n\nLenin began to practice law\nin the Samara Regional Court,\nand he appeared for defense in court about twenty times\nduring the period of 1892–93.\nHis legal practice, however,\nwas secondary only to diligently studying Marxism\nto prepare himself for revolutionary work.\nIn

Russian social-democrats\nas spreading the teachings of scientific socialism\nand fighting against czarism,\nand The development of capitalism in Russia,\na thorough and profoundly researched study\non the economic development of Russia\npublished in 1899\nunder a pseudonym.\nThe book provided,\nthrough extensive analysis\nand ample statistical evidence,\na well-reasoned argument\nin support of a revolutionary alliance\nbetween working class and peasantry,\nconsidering Imperial Russia's historical conditions,\nand showed that a process of economic differentiation\nhad begun among the peasants,\na few of which were becoming kulaks,\nor the rural bourgeoisie.\n\nThe first congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP)\nwas held in March, 1898 in Minsk,\nwhich founded the party\nand showed that the organization was growing withstanding the blows it received from the arrest of its leaders.\nAlthough the congress and its Manifesto\nwere in many respects lacking, at the time,\nLenin described the foundation of the RSDLP\nas \"the biggest step taken by the Russian working-class movement\nin its fusion with the Russian revolutionary movement.\n\"\nWith the publication of The development of capitalism in Russia\nin 1899,\nLenin begun a struggle\nagainst the anti-Marxist ideologues\nknown at the time as the Narodnik\nand the \"legal Marxists\",\nrepresented especially by Bernstein,\nwhose ideas Lenin described as \"an attempt to narrow the theory of Marxism,\nto convert the revolutionary workers' party\ninto a reformist party\".\n\nThe idea of creating of a single, united Marxist party in Russia\noccupied a central place\nin Lenin's writings\nat the time of his exile in Siberia.\nLenin wrote three articles for the Workers' Gazette,\nwhich had been adopted\nas the official newspaper organ of the RSDLP,\non the question of founding a Marxist party,\nOur programme, Our immediate task,\nAn urgent question.\nThese articles were published only in 1925,\nbecause the Central Committee was arrested\nand the newspapers organ of the RSDLP was destroyed.\nAt the end of his exile,\nLenin didn't have his term
