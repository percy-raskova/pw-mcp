{"chunk_id": "Main/Library_Vladimir_Lenin_Left-wing_communism,_an_infantile_disorder#1", "text": "We shall, however,\ndeal with this pamphlet\nin greater detail\nsome other time.\nWe shall here note only one more point:\nin bygone days,\nwhen he was still a Marxist\nand not a renegade, Kautsky,\ndealing with the question as an historian,\nforesaw the possibility of a situation\narising in which the revolutionary spirit of the Russian proletariat\nwould provide a model to Western Europe.\nThis was in 1902,\nwhen Kautsky wrote an article for the revolutionary Iskra,\nentitled “The Slavs and Revolution”.\nHere is what he wrote in the article:\n<blockquote>“\nAt the present time [in contrast with 1848]\nit would seem that not only have the Slavs entered the ranks of the revolutionary nations,\nbut that the centre of revolutionary thought and revolutionary action\nis shifting more and more to the Slavs.\nThe revolutionary centre is shifting from the West to the East.\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century\nit was located in France,\nat times in England.\nIn 1848 Germany too joined the ranks of the revolutionary nations...\nThe new century has begun with events\nwhich suggest the idea that we are approaching\na further shift of the revolutionary centre,\nnamely, to Russia...\nRussia,\nwhich has borrowed so much revolutionary initiative from the West,\nis now perhaps herself ready to serve the West\nas a source of revolutionary energy.\nThe Russian revolutionary movement\nthat is now flaring up\nwill perhaps prove to be the most potent means of exorcising the spirit of flabby philistinism\nand coldly calculating politics\nthat is beginning to spread in our midst,\nand it may cause the fighting spirit\nand the passionate devotion to our great ideals\nto flare up again.\nTo Western Europe,\nRussia has long ceased to be a bulwark of reaction and absolutism.\nI think the reverse is true today.\nWestern Europe is becoming Russia’s bulwark of reaction and absolutism...\nThe Russian revolutionaries might perhaps have coped with the tsar\nlong ago\nhad they not been compelled\nat the same time\nto fight his ally—European capital.\nLet us hope that this time they will succeed\nin coping with both enemies,\nand that the new ‘Holy Alliance’\nwill collapse more rapidly\nthan its predecessors did.\nHowever the present struggle in Russia\nmay end,\nthe blood and suffering of the martyrs\nwhom, unfortunately, it will produce in too great numbers,\nwill not have been in vain.\nThey will nourish the shoots of social revolution\nthroughout the civilized world\nand make them grow more luxuriantly and rapidly.\nIn 1848\nthe Slavs were a killing frost\nwhich blighted the flowers of the people’s spring.\nPerhaps they are now destined to be the storm\nthat will break the ice of reaction\nand irresistibly bring with it a new and happy spring for the nations\n”</blockquote>\nHow well Karl Kautsky wrote eighteen years ago!\n\nAn essential condition of the Bolsheviks’ success\nIt is,\nI think, almost universally realized at present\nthat the Bolsheviks could not have retained power\nfor two and a half months,\nlet alone two and a half years,\nwithout the most rigorous and truly iron discipline in our Party,\nor without the fullest and unreserved support\nfrom the entire mass of the working class,\nthat is, from all thinking, honest, devoted and influential elements in it,\ncapable of leading the backward strata\nor carrying the latter along with them.\n\nThe dictatorship of the proletariat\nmeans a most determined and most ruthless war\nwaged by the new class\nagainst a more powerful enemy,\nthe bourgeoisie,\nwhose resistance is increased tenfold\nby their overthrow\n(even if only in a single country),\nand whose power lies,\nnot only in the strength of international capital,\nthe strength and durability\nof their international connections,\nbut also in the force of habit,\nin the strength of small-scale production.\nUnfortunately,\nsmall-scale production is still widespread in the world,\nand small-scale production\nengenders capitalism\nand the bourgeoisie continuously,\ndaily, hourly, spontaneously, and on a mass scale.\nAll these reasons\nmake the dictatorship of the proletariat necessary,\nand victory over the bourgeoisie\nis impossible\nwithout a long, stubborn and desperate life-and-death struggle\nwhich calls for tenacity, discipline, and a single and inflexible will.\n\nI repeat:\nthe experience of the victorious dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia\nhas clearly shown even to those who are incapable of thinking\nor have had no occasion to give thought to the matter\nthat absolute centralization\nand rigorous discipline of the proletariat\nare an essential condition of victory over the bourgeoisie.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin Left-wing communism, an infantile disorder", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 1, "line_range":

what conditions it is possible.\nWould it not be better if the salutations addressed to the Soviets\nand the Bolsheviks\nwere more frequently accompanied by a profound analysis\nof the reasons why the Bolsheviks have been able to build up the discipline\nneeded by the revolutionary proletariat?\n\nAs a current of political thought\nand as a political party,\nBolshevism has existed since 1903.\nOnly the history of Bolshevism\nduring the entire period of its existence\ncan satisfactorily explain why it has been able to build up and maintain,\nunder most difficult conditions,\nthe iron discipline\nneeded for the victory of the proletariat.\n\nThe first questions to arise are:\nhow is the discipline of the proletariat’s revolutionary party maintained?\nHow is it tested?\nHow is it reinforced?\nFirst,\nby the class-consciousness of the proletarian vanguard\nand by its devotion to the revolution,\nby its tenacity,\nself-sacrifice and heroism.\nSecond, by its ability to link up,\nmaintain the closest contact,\nand—if you wish—\nmerge, in certain measure,\nwith the broadest masses\nof the working people—\nprimarily with the proletariat,\nbut also with the non-proletarian masses of working people.\nThird,\nby the correctness of the political leadership\nexercised by this vanguard,\nby the correctness of its political strategy and tactics,\nprovided the broad masses\nhave seen,\nfrom their own experience,\nthat they are correct.\nWithout these conditions,\ndiscipline in a revolutionary party\nreally capable of being the party of the advanced class,\nwhose mission it is to overthrow the bourgeoisie\nand transform the whole of society,\ncannot be achieved.\nWithout these conditions,\nall attempts to establish discipline\ninevitably fall flat\nand end up in phrasemongering and clowning.\nOn the other hand,\nthese conditions cannot emerge at once.\nThey are created only by prolonged effort\nand hard-won experience.\nTheir creation is facilitated by a correct revolutionary theory,\nwhich, in its turn,\nis not a dogma,\nbut assumes final shape\nonly in close connection\nwith the practical activity\nof a truly mass and truly revolutionary movement.\n\nThe fact that, in 1917–20,\nBolshevism was able,\nunder unprecedentedly difficult conditions,\nto build up and successfully maintain the strictest centralization and iron discipline\nwas due simply to a number of historical peculiarities of Russia.\n\nOn the one hand,\nBolshevism arose in 1903\non a very firm foundation of Marxist theory.\nThe correctness of this revolutionary theory,\nand of it alone,\nhas been proved,\nnot only by world experience throughout the nineteenth century,\nbut especially by the experience of the seekings and vacillations,\nthe errors and disappointments of revolutionary thought in Russia.\nFor about half a century—\napproximately from the forties to the nineties of the last century—\nprogressive thought in Russia,\noppressed by a most brutal and reactionary tsarism,\nsought eagerly for a correct revolutionary theory,\nand followed with the utmost diligence and thoroughness\neach and every “last word”\nin this sphere\nin Europe and America.\nRussia achieved Marxism—\nthe only correct revolutionary theory—\nthrough the agony she experienced\nin the course of half a century\nof unparalleled torment and sacrifice,\nof unparalleled revolutionary heroism,\nincredible energy,\ndevoted searching, study, practical trial, disappointment, verification, and comparison with European experience.\nThanks to the political emigration\ncaused by tsarism,\nrevolutionary Russia,\nin the second half of the nineteenth century,\nacquired a wealth of international links\nand excellent information\non the forms and theories of the world revolutionary movement,\nsuch as no other country possessed.\n\nOn the other hand,\nBolshevism,\nwhich had arisen on this granite foundation of theory,\nwent through fifteen years of practical history (1903–17)\nunequalled anywhere in the world\nin its wealth of experience.\nDuring those fifteen years,\nno other country knew anything even approximating to that revolutionary experience,\nthat rapid and varied succession\nof different forms of the movement\n—\nlegal and illegal,\npeaceful and stormy,\nunderground and open,\nlocal circles and mass movements,\nand parliamentary and terrorist forms.\nIn no other country has there been concentrated,\nin so brief a period,\nsuch a wealth of forms, shades,\nand methods of struggle\nof all classes of modern society,\na struggle which, owing to the backwardness of the country\nand the severity of the tsarist yoke,\nmatured with exceptional rapidity,\nand assimilated most eagerly\nand successfully\nthe

revolution.\nRepresentatives of the three main classes,\nof the three principal political trends—\nthe liberal-bourgeois,\nthe petty-bourgeois-democratic\n(concealed behind “social-democratic” and “social-revolutionary” labels),\nand the proletarian-revolutionary—\nanticipated and prepared the impending open class struggle\nby waging a most bitter struggle\non issues of programme and

a class nature\ncrystallised in the struggle of press organs, parties, factions and groups;\nthe classes were forging the requisite political and ideological weapons\nfor the impending battles.\n\nThe years of revolution (1905–07).\nAll classes came out into the open.\nAll programmatical and tactical views\nwere tested by the action of the masses.\nIn its extent and acuteness,\nthe strike struggle had no parallel anywhere in the world.\nThe economic strike\ndeveloped into a political strike,\nand the latter into insurrection.\nThe relations between the proletariat,\nas the leader,\nand the vacillating and unstable peasantry,\nas the led,\nwere tested in practice.\nThe Soviet form of organization\ncame into being in the spontaneous development of the struggle.\nThe controversies of that period\nover the significance of the Soviets\nanticipated the great struggle of 1917–20.\nThe alternation of parliamentary and non-parliamentary forms of struggle,\nof the tactics of boycotting parliament\nand that of participating in parliament,\nof legal and illegal forms of struggle,\nand likewise their interrelations and connections—\nall this was marked by an extraordinary wealth of content.\nAs for teaching the fundamentals of political science\nto masses and leaders,\nto classes and parties alike,\neach month of this period\nwas equivalent to an entire year\nof “peaceful” and

drift\ntowards philosophical idealism;\nmysticism became the garb\nof counter-revolutionary sentiments.\nAt the same time, however,\nit was this great defeat\nthat taught the revolutionary parties\nand the revolutionary class\na real and very useful lesson,\na lesson in historical dialectics,\na lesson in an understanding of the political struggle,\nand in the art and science of waging that struggle.\nIt is at moments of need that one learns who one’s friends are.\nDefeated armies learn their lesson.\n\nVictorious tsarism\nwas compelled to speed up the destruction\nof the remnants

movement.\nThe two monstrosities complemented each other.\nAnd if in Russia—\ndespite the more petty-bourgeois composition of her population\nas compared with the other European countries—\nanarchism’s influence was negligible\nduring the two revolutions (of 1905 and 1917)\nand the preparations for them,\nthis should no doubt stand partly to the credit of Bolshevism,\nwhich has always waged a most ruthless and uncompromising struggle\nagainst opportunism.\nI say “partly”,\nsince of still greater importance\nin weakening anarchism’s influence in Russia\nwas the circumstance\nthat in the past (the seventies of the nineteenth century)\nit was able to develop inordinately\nand to reveal its absolute erroneousness,\nits unfitness\nto serve the revolutionary class\nas a guiding theory.\n\nWhen it came into being in 1903,\nBolshevism took over the tradition\nof a ruthless struggle\nagainst petty-bourgeois,\nsemi-anarchist (or dilettante-anarchist) revolutionism,\na tradition which had always existed\nin revolutionary Social-Democracy\nand had become particularly strong in our country\nduring the years 1900–03,\nwhen the foundations for a mass party\nof the revolutionary proletariat\nwere being laid in Russia.\nBolshevism took over and carried on the struggle against a party\nwhich, more than any other,\nexpressed the tendencies\nof petty-bourgeois revolutionism,\nnamely, the “Socialist-Revolutionary” Party,\nand waged that struggle\non three main issues.\nFirst, that party,\nwhich rejected Marxism,\nstubbornly refused\n(or, it might be more correct to say:\nwas unable)\nto understand the need for a strictly objective appraisal\nof the class forces\nand their alignment,\nbefore taking any political action.\nSecond,\nthis party considered itself particularly “revolutionary”,\nor “Left”,\nbecause of its recognition\nof individual terrorism,\nassassination—\nsomething that we Marxists emphatically rejected.\nIt was, of course,\nonly on grounds of expediency\nthat we rejected individual terrorism,\nwhereas people who were capable of condemning “on principle”\nthe terror of the Great French Revolution,\nor, in general,\nthe terror employed by a victorious revolutionary party\nwhich is besieged by the bourgeoisie of the whole world,\nwere ridiculed\nand laughed to scorn by Plekhanov in 1900–03,\nwhen he was a Marxist and a revolutionary.\nThird,\nthe “Socialist-Revolutionaries”\nthought it very “Left”\nto sneer at the comparatively insignificant opportunist sins\nof the German Social-Democratic Party,\nwhile they themselves imitated the extreme opportunists\nof that party,\nfor example,\non the agrarian question,\nor on the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nHistory,\nincidentally,\nhas now confirmed on a vast and world-wide scale\nthe opinion we have always advocated,\nnamely,\nthat German revolutionary Social-Democracy\n(note that as far back as 1900–03\nPlekhanov demanded Bernstein’s expulsion from the Party,\nand in 1913 the Bolsheviks,\nalways continuing this tradition,\nexposed Legien’s baseness, vileness and treachery)\ncame closest to being the party\nthe revolutionary proletariat needs\nin order to achieve victory.\nToday, in 1920,\nafter all the ignominious failures and crises\nof the war period\nand the early post-war years,\nit can be plainly seen that,\nof all the Western parties,\nthe German revolutionary Social-Democrats\nproduced the finest leaders,\nand recovered and gained new strength more rapidly\nthan the others did.\nThis may be seen in the instances\nboth of the Spartacists and the Left,\nproletarian wing of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany,\nwhich is waging an incessant struggle\nagainst the opportunism\nand spinelessness\nof the Kautskys,\nHilferdings, Ledebours and Crispiens.\nIf we now cast a glance\nto take in a complete historical period,\nnamely,\nfrom the Paris Commune to the first Socialist Soviet Republic,\nwe shall find that Marxism’s attitude to anarchism in general\nstands out\nmost definitely and unmistakably.\nIn the final analysis,\nMarxism proved to be correct,\nand although the anarchists rightly pointed to the opportunist views\non the state prevalent\namong most of the socialist parties,\nit must be said,\nfirst,\nthat this opportunism\nwas connected with the distortion,\nand even deliberate suppression,\nof Marx’s views on the state\n(in my book, The state and revolution,\nI pointed out that for thirty-six years,\nfrom 1875 to 1911,\nBebel withheld a letter by Engels,\nwhich very clearly, vividly,\nbluntly and definitively exposed the opportunism\nof the current Social-Democratic views on the state);\nsecond,\nthat

particularly large proportions\non two occasions:\nin 1908,\non the question of whether or not to participate\nin a most reactionary “parliament”\nand in the legal workers’ societies,\nwhich were being restricted by most reactionary laws;\nand again in 1918\n(the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk),\non the question of whether one “compromise” or another was permissible.\n\nIn 1908\nthe “Left” Bolsheviks\nwere expelled from our Party\nfor stubbornly refusing to understand the necessity of participating\nin a most reactionary “parliament”.\nThe “Lefts”—among whom there were many splendid revolutionaries\nwho subsequently were (and still are) commendable members of the Communist Party—\nbased themselves particularly on the successful experience of the 1905 boycott.\nWhen, in August 1905,\nthe tsar proclaimed the convocation of a consultative “parliament”,\nthe Bolsheviks called for its boycott,\nin the teeth of all the opposition parties\nand the Mensheviks,\nand the “parliament”\nwas in fact swept away by the revolution of October 1905.\nThe boycott proved correct at the time,\nnot because nonparticipation in reactionary parliaments\nis correct in general,\nbut because we accurately appraised the objective situation,\nwhich was leading to the rapid development\nof the mass strikes\nfirst\ninto a political strike,\nthen into a revolutionary strike,\nand finally into an uprising.\nMoreover,\nthe struggle centred at that time\non the question\nof whether the convocation of the first representative assembly\nshould be left to the tsar,\nor an attempt\nshould be made\nto wrest its convocation from the old regime.\nWhen there was not,\nand could not be,\nany certainty\nthat the objective situation\nwas of a similar kind,\nand when there was no certainty of a similar trend\nand the same rate of development,\nthe boycott was no longer correct.\n\nThe Bolsheviks’ boycott of “parliament” in 1905\nenriched the revolutionary proletariat\nwith highly valuable political experience\nand showed that,\nwhen legal and illegal parliamentary and non-parliamentary forms of struggle\nare combined,\nit is sometimes useful\nand even essential to reject parliamentary forms.\nIt would, however, be highly erroneous\nto apply this experience blindly,\nimitatively and uncritically\nto other conditions and other situations.\nThe Bolsheviks’ boycott of the Duma in 1906\nwas a mistake,\nalthough a minor and easily remediable one.\nThe boycott of the Duma in 1907, 1908 and subsequent years\nwas a most serious error\nand difficult to remedy,\nbecause, on the one hand,\na very rapid rise of the revolutionary tide\nand its conversion into an uprising\nwas not to be expected,\nand, on the other hand,\nthe entire historical situation\nattendant upon the renovation of the bourgeois monarchy\ncalled for legal and illegal activities being combined.\nToday, when we look back at this fully completed historical period,\nwhose connection with subsequent periods\nhas now become quite clear,\nit becomes most obvious\nthat in 1908–14\nthe Bolsheviks could not have preserved\n(let alone strengthened and developed)\nthe core of the revolutionary party of the proletariat,\nhad they not upheld,\nin a most strenuous struggle,\nthe viewpoint that it was obligatory\nto combine legal and illegal forms of struggle,\nand that it was obligatory to participate even in a most reactionary parliament\nand in a number of other institutions\nhemmed in by reactionary laws\n(sick benefit societies, etc.).\n\nIn 1918 things did not reach a split.\nAt that time\nthe “Left” Communists\nformed only a separate group or “faction” within our Party,\nand that not for long.\nIn the same year, 1918,\nthe most prominent representatives of “Left Communism”,\nfor example,\nComrades Radek and Bukharin,\nopenly acknowledged their error.\nIt had seemed to them\nthat the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\nwas a compromise with the imperialists,\nwhich was inexcusable on principle and harmful to the party of the revolutionary proletariat.\nIt was indeed a compromise with the imperialists,\nbut it was a compromise\nwhich, under the circumstances,\nhad to be made.\n\nToday,\nwhen I hear our tactics\nin signing the Brest-Litovsk Treaty\nbeing attacked by the Socialist-Revolutionaries,\nfor instance,\nor when I hear Comrade Lansbury say,\nin a conversation with me,\n“\nOur British trade union leaders say that if it was permissible for the Bolsheviks to compromise,\nit is permissible for them to compromise too”,\nI usually reply by first of

opportunity to get away from you with a whole skin).\nIt would, however, be difficult to find a sane man\nwho would declare such a compromise\nto be “inadmissible on principle”,\nor who would call the compromiser\nan accomplice of the bandits\n(even though the bandits might use the car and the firearms for further robberies).\nOur compromise with the bandits of German imperialism\nwas just that kind of compromise.\n\nBut when, in 1914–18\nand then in 1918–20,\nthe Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in Russia,\nthe Scheidemannites (and to a large extent the Kautskyites)\nin Germany,\nOtto Bauer and Friedrich Adler\n(to say nothing of the Renners and Co.)\nin Austria,\nthe Renaudels and Longuets and Co.\nin France,\nthe Fabians,\nthe Independents and the Labourites in Britain\nentered into compromises\nwith the bandits of their own bourgeoisie,\nand sometimes of the “Allied” bourgeoisie,\nand against the revolutionary proletariat of their own countries,\nall these gentlemen were actually acting as accomplices in banditry.\n\nThe conclusion is clear:\nto reject compromises “on principle”,\nto reject the permissibility of compromises in general,\nno matter of what kind,\nis childishness,\nwhich it is difficult even to consider seriously.\nA political leader\nwho desires to be useful\nto the revolutionary proletariat\nmust be able to distinguish concrete cases of compromises\nthat are inexcusable\nand are an expression of opportunism and treachery;\nhe must direct all the force of criticism,\nthe full intensity of merciless exposure\nand relentless war,\nagainst these concrete compromises,\nand not allow the past masters\nof “practical” socialism\nand the parliamentary Jesuits to dodge and wriggle out of responsibility\nby means of disquisitions\non “compromises in general”.\nIt is in this way\nthat the “leaders”\nof the British trade unions,\nas well as of the Fabian society\nand the “Independent” Labour Party,\ndodge

kinds of compromises.\nOne must be able to analyze the situation\nand the concrete conditions\nof each compromise,\nor of each variety of compromise.\nOne must learn to distinguish between a man who has given up his money and fire-arms to bandits\nso as to lessen the evil they can do and to facilitate their capture and execution,\nand a man who gives his money and fire-arms to bandits\nso as to share in the loot.\nIn politics\nthis is by no means always as elementary as it is in this childishly simple example.\nHowever,\nanyone who is out to think up for the workers\nsome kind of

situations,\nis simply a charlatan.\n\nTo leave no room for misinterpretation,\nI shall attempt to outline,\nif only very briefly,\nseveral fundamental rules\nfor the analysis of concrete compromises.\n\nThe party\nwhich entered into a compromise\nwith the German imperialists\nby signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\nhad been evolving its internationalism\nin practice\never since the

There—the dictatorship of leaders;\nhere—the dictatorship of the masses!\nThat is our slogan.\n”</blockquote>\nSuch are the main features characterizing the views of the opposition in the German Communist Party.\n\nAny Bolshevik who has consciously participated in the development of Bolshevism\nsince 1903\nor has closely observed\nthat development will at once say,\nafter reading these arguments,\n“\nWhat old and familiar rubbish!\nWhat ‘Left-wing’ childishness!”\n\nBut let us examine these arguments a little more closely.\n\nThe mere presentation of the question—\n“dictatorship of the party or dictatorship of the class;\ndictatorship (party) of the leaders,\nor dictatorship (party) of the masses?”—\ntestifies to most incredibly and hopelessly muddled thinking.\nThese people want to invent something quite out of the ordinary,\nand, in their effort to be clever,\nmake themselves ridiculous.\nIt is common knowledge\nthat the masses are divided into classes,\nthat the masses can be contrasted with classes\nonly\nby contrasting the vast majority in general,\nregardless of division\naccording to status in the social system of production,\nwith categories holding a definite status\nin the social system of production;\nthat as a rule and in most cases—\nat least in present-day civilized countries—\nclasses are led by political parties;\nthat political parties, as a general rule,\nare run by more or less stable groups\ncomposed of the most authoritative,\ninfluential and experienced members,\nwho are elected to the most responsible positions,\nand are called leaders.\nAll this is elementary.\nAll this is clear and simple.\nWhy replace this\nwith some kind of rigmarole,\nsome new Volapük?\nOn the one hand,\nthese people seem to have got muddled\nwhen they found themselves in a predicament,\nwhen the party’s abrupt transition\nfrom legality to illegality\nupset the customary,\nnormal and simple relations\nbetween leaders, parties and classes.\nIn Germany,\nas in other European countries,\npeople had become too accustomed to legality,\nto the free and proper election of “leaders”\nat regular party congresses,\nto the convenient method of testing the class composition of parties\nthrough parliamentary elections,\nmass meetings the press,\nthe sentiments of the trade unions and other associations,\netc.\nWhen, instead of this customary procedure,\nit became necessary,\nbecause of the stormy development of the revolution\nand the development of the civil war,\nto go over rapidly\nfrom legality to illegality,\nto combine the two,\nand to adopt the “inconvenient”\nand “undemocratic”\nmethods of selecting, or forming,\nor preserving “groups of leaders”—\npeople lost their bearings\nand began to think up some unmitigated nonsense.\nCertain members of the Communist Party of Holland,\nwho were unlucky enough to be born in a small country\nwith traditions and conditions\nof highly privileged\nand highly stable legality,\nand who had never seen a transition from legality to illegality,\nprobably fell into confusion, lost their heads,\nand helped create these absurd inventions.\n\nOn the other hand,\none can see simply a thoughtless and incoherent use of the now “fashionable” terms: “masses” and “leaders”.\nThese people have heard and memorised a great many attacks on “leaders”,\nin which the latter have been contrasted with the “masses”;\nhowever,\nthey have proved unable to think matters out\nand gain a clear understanding of what it was all about.\n\nThe divergence\nbetween “leaders” and “masses”\nwas brought out\nwith particular clarity and sharpness in all countries\nat the end of the imperialist war\nand following it.\nThe principal reason for this\nwas explained many times\nby Marx and Engels\nbetween the years 1852 and 1892,\nfrom the example of Britain.\nThat country’s exclusive position\nled to the emergence,\nfrom the “masses”,\nof a semi–petty-bourgeois,\nopportunist “labor aristocracy”.\nThe leaders of this labor aristocracy\nwere constantly going over to the bourgeoisie,\nand were directly or indirectly on its pay roll.\nMarx earned the honour\nof incurring the hatred\nof these disreputable persons\nby openly branding them as traitors.\nPresent-day (twentieth-century)\nimperialism\nhas given a few advanced countries\nan exceptionally privileged position,\nwhich, everywhere in the Second International,\nhas produced a certain type of traitor,\nopportunist,\nand social-chauvinist leaders,\nwho champion the interests\nof their own craft,\ntheir own section of the labor aristocracy.\nThe opportunist parties\nhave become separated from the “masses”,\ni.e.,\nfrom the broadest strata\nof the working people,\ntheir majority,\nthe lowest-paid workers.\nThe revolutionary proletariat cannot be victorious\nunless this evil is combated,\nunless the opportunist,\nsocial-traitor leaders are exposed,\ndiscredited and expelled.\nThat is the policy the Third International\nhas embarked on.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin Left-wing communism, an infantile disorder", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 10, "line_range":

of the dictatorship\nof the proletariat and its party to the trade unions,\nare concretely as follows:\nthe dictatorship is exercised by the proletariat organized in the Soviets;\nthe proletariat is guided by the Communist Party of Bolsheviks,\nwhich, according to the figures of the latest Party Congress (April 1920),\nhas a membership of 611,000.\nThe membership varied greatly both before and after the October Revolution,\nand used to be much smaller,\neven in 1918 and 1919.\nWe are apprehensive\nof an excessive growth of the Party,\nbecause careerists and charlatans,\nwho deserve only to be shot,\ninevitably do all they can\nto insinuate themselves\ninto the ranks of the ruling party.\nThe last time we opened wide the doors of the Party—to workers and peasants only—\nwas when (in the winter of 1919) Yudenich\nwas within a few versts of Petrograd,\nand Denikin was in Orel (about 350 versts from Moscow),\ni.e.,\nwhen the Soviet Republic was in mortal danger,\nand when adventurers, careerists, charlatans and unreliable persons\ngenerally could not possibly count\non making a profitable career\n(and had more reason to expect the gallows and torture)\nby joining the Communists.\nThe Party,\nwhich holds annual congresses\n(the most recent on the basis of one delegate per 1,000 members),\nis directed by a Central Committee of nineteen elected at the Congress,\nwhile the current work in Moscow\nhas to be carried on by still smaller bodies,\nknown as the Organising Bureau\nand the Political Bureau,\nwhich are elected at plenary meetings\nof the Central Committee,\nfive members of the Central Committee to each bureau.\nThis, it would appear,\nis a full-fledged “oligarchy”.\nNo important political or organizational question\nis decided\nby any state institution in our republic\nwithout the guidance of the Party’s Central Committee.\n\nIn its work,\nthe Party relies directly on the trade unions,\nwhich, according to the data of the last congress (April 1920),\nnow have a membership of over four million\nand are formally non-Party.\nActually,\nall the directing bodies\nof the vast majority of the unions,\nand primarily, of course,\nof the all-Russia general trade union centre\nor bureau\n(the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions),\nare made up of Communists\nand carry out all the directives of the Party.\nThus, on the whole,\nwe have a formally non-communist,\nflexible and relatively wide\nand very powerful proletarian apparatus,\nby means of which the Party is closely linked up with the class and the masses,\nand by means of which, under the leadership of the Party,\nthe class dictatorship is exercised.\nWithout close contacts\nwith the trade unions,\nand without their energetic support\nand devoted efforts,\nnot only in economic, but also in military affairs,\nit would of course have been impossible for us\nto govern the country\nand to maintain the dictatorship\nfor two and a half months,\nlet alone two and a half years.\nIn practice,\nthese very close contacts\nnaturally\ncall for highly complex and diversified work\nin the form of propaganda,\nagitation, timely and frequent conferences,\nnot only with the leading trade union workers,\nbut with influential trade union workers generally;\nthey call for a determined struggle\nagainst the Mensheviks,\nwho still have a certain though very small following to whom they teach all kinds of counter-revolutionary machinations,\nranging from an ideological defense of (bourgeois) democracy\nand the preaching\nthat the trade unions\nshould be “independent”\n(independent of proletarian state power!)\nto sabotage of proletarian discipline, etc.,\netc.\n\nWe consider that contacts with the “masses”\nthrough the trade unions\nare not enough.\nIn the course of our revolution,\npractical activities have given rise to such institutions\nas non-Party workers’ and peasants’ conferences,\nand we strive by every means to support,\ndevelop and extend this institution\nin order to be able to observe the temper of the masses,\ncome closer to them,\nmeet their requirements,\npromote the best among them\nto state posts, etc.\nUnder a recent decree\non the transformation of the People’s Commissariat of State Control\ninto the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection,\nnon-Party conferences of this kind\nhave been

sense.\nHowever,\neverybody knows that this is still a far cry\nfrom overcoming it in practice.\nCapitalism could have been declared—\nand with full justice—\nto be “historically obsolete”\nmany decades ago,\nbut that does not at all\nremove the need for a very long and very persistent struggle\non the basis of capitalism.\nParliamentarianism is “historically obsolete”\nfrom the standpoint of world history,\ni.e., the era of bourgeois parliamentarianism is over,\nand the era of the proletarian dictatorship\nhas begun.\nThat is incontestable.\nBut world history is counted in decades.\nTen or twenty years earlier\nor later\nmakes no difference\nwhen measured with the yardstick of world history;\nfrom the standpoint of world history\nit is a trifle\nthat cannot be considered even approximately.\nBut for that very reason,\nit is a glaring theoretical error\nto apply the yardstick of world history\nto practical politics.\n\nIs parliamentarianism “politically obsolete”?\nThat is quite a different matter.\nIf that were true,\nthe position of the “Lefts”\nwould be a strong one.\nBut it has to be proved by a most searching analysis,\nand the “Lefts”\ndo not even know how to approach the matter.\nIn the “Theses on Parliamentarianism”,\npublished in the Bulletin of the Provisional Bureau in Amsterdam\nof the Communist International No. 1, February 1920,\nand obviously expressing the Dutch-Left or Left-Dutch strivings,\nthe analysis, as we shall see,\nis also hopelessly poor.\n\nIn the first place,\ncontrary to the opinion\nof such outstanding political leaders\nas Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht,\nthe German “Lefts”,\nas we know,\nconsidered parliamentarianism “politically obsolete”\neven in January 1919.\nWe know that the “Lefts”\nwere mistaken.\nThis fact alone utterly destroys,\nat a single stroke,\nthe proposition that parliamentarianism is “politically obsolete”.\nIt is for the “Lefts”\nto prove why their error,\nindisputable at that time,\nis no longer an error.\nThey do not and cannot produce even a shred of proof.\nA political party’s attitude towards its own mistakes\nis one of the most important\nand surest ways\nof judging how earnest the party is\nand how it fulfils in practice its obligations\ntowards its class and the working people.\nFrankly acknowledging a mistake,\nascertaining the reasons for it,\nanalyzing the conditions that have led up to it,\nand thrashing out the means of its rectification—\nthat is the hallmark of a serious party;\nthat is how it should perform its duties,\nand how it should educate and train its class,\nand then the masses.\nBy failing to fulfil this duty\nand give the utmost attention\nand consideration\nto the study of their patent error,\nthe “Lefts” in Germany\n(and in Holland)\nhave proved that they are not a party of a class,\nbut a circle,\nnot a party of the masses,\nbut a group of intellectualists\nand of a few workers\nwho ape the worst features of intellectualism.",

forth\nhere is incontrovertible,\nand its acknowledgment by the “Lefts”\nis particularly clear evidence of their mistake.\nHow can one say that “parliamentarianism is politically obsolete”,\nwhen “millions” and “legions” of proletarians\nare not only still in favour of parliamentarianism in general,\nbut are downright “counter-revolutionary”!?\nIt is obvious\nthat parliamentarianism in

dangerous mistake\nfor revolutionaries to make.\nIn Russia—\nwhere,\nover a particularly long period\nand in particularly varied forms,\nthe most brutal and savage yoke of tsarism\nproduced

“Lefts”\ndo not know how to reason,\ndo not know how to act as the party of a class,\nas the party of the masses.\nYou must not sink to the level of the masses,\nto the level of the backward strata of

sentence is amazingly illogical.\nIf a parliament becomes an organ\nand a “centre”\n(in reality it never has been and never can be a “centre”,\nbut that is by the way)\nof counter-revolution,\nwhile the workers are building up the instruments of their power\nin the form of the Soviets,\nthen it follows\nthat the workers must prepare—\nideologically, politically and technically—\nfor the struggle of the Soviets against parliament,\nfor the dispersal of parliament by the Soviets.\nBut it does not at all\nfollow\nthat this dispersal\nis hindered,\nor is not facilitated,\nby the presence of a Soviet opposition\nwithin the counter-revolutionary parliament.\nIn the course of our victorious struggle\nagainst Denikin and Kolchak,\nwe never found that\nthe existence of a Soviet and proletarian opposition in their camp\nwas immaterial\nto our victories.\nWe know perfectly well\nthat\nthe dispersal of the Constituent Assembly\non January 5, 1918\nwas not hampered\nbut was actually facilitated\nby the fact that,\nwithin the counter-revolutionary Constituent Assembly\nwhich was about to be dispersed,\nthere was a consistent Bolshevik,\nas well as an inconsistent,\nLeft Socialist-Revolutionary Soviet opposition.\nThe authors of the theses\nare engaged in muddled thinking;\nthey have forgotten the experience\nof many, if not all, revolutions,\nwhich shows the great usefulness,\nduring a revolution,\nof a combination of mass action\noutside a reactionary parliament\nwith an opposition sympathetic to (or, better still, directly supporting) the revolution within it.\nThe Dutch,\nand the “Lefts” in general,\nargue in this respect\nlike doctrinaires of the revolution,\nwho have never taken part in a real revolution,\nhave never given thought to the history of revolutions,\nor have naïvely mistaken\nsubjective “rejection”\nof a reactionary institution\nfor its actual destruction\nby the combined operation\nof a number of objective factors.\nThe surest way of discrediting\nand damaging a new political (and not only political) idea\nis to reduce it to absurdity\non the plea of defending it.\nFor any truth,\nif “overdone”\n(as Dietzgen Senior put it),\nif exaggerated,\nor if carried beyond the limits\nof its actual applicability,\ncan be reduced to an absurdity,\nand is even bound\nto become an absurdity\nunder these conditions.\nThat is just the kind of disservice\nthe Dutch and German Lefts\nare rendering to the new truth\nof the Soviet form of government\nbeing superior to bourgeois-democratic parliaments.\nOf course,\nanyone would be in error\nwho voiced the outmoded viewpoint\nor in general considered it impermissible,\nin all and any circumstances,\nto reject participation in bourgeois parliaments.\nI cannot attempt here\nto

questions\nof international communist tactics.\nRussian experience\nhas provided us\nwith one successful and correct instance (1905),\nand another that was incorrect (1906),\nof the use of a boycott by the Bolsheviks.\nAnalyzing the first case,\nwe, see that we succeeded in preventing a reactionary government\nfrom convening a reactionary parliament\nin a situation in which extra-parliamentary revolutionary mass action (strikes in particular)\nwas developing at great speed,\nwhen not a single section of the proletariat and the peasantry\ncould support the reactionary government\nin any way,\nand when the revolutionary proletariat was gaining influence\nover the backward masses\nthrough the strike struggle\nand through the agrarian movement.\nIt is quite obvious\nthat this experience\nis not applicable\nto present-day European conditions.\nIt is likewise quite obvious—\nand the foregoing arguments\nbear this out—\nthat the advocacy,\neven if with reservations,\nby the

proletarian has been through strikes\nand has experienced “compromises”\nwith the hated oppressors and exploiters,\nwhen the workers have had to return to work\neither without having achieved anything or else\nagreeing to only a partial satisfaction of their demands.\nEvery proletarian—\nas a result of the conditions of the mass struggle\nand the acute intensification\nof class antagonisms\nhe lives among—\nsees the difference\nbetween a compromise\nenforced by objective conditions\n(such as lack of strike funds,\nno outside support, starvation and exhaustion)—\na compromise\nwhich in no way minimises the revolutionary devotion\nand readiness\nto carry on the struggle\non the part of the workers\nwho have agreed to such a compromise—\nand, on the other hand,\na compromise by traitors\nwho try to ascribe to objective causes\ntheir self-interest\n(strike-breakers also enter into “compromises”!),\ntheir cowardice,\ndesire to toady to the capitalists,\nand readiness to yield

not yet know that in nature and in society\nall distinctions\nare fluid and up to a certain point conventional,\nnothing can help them but lengthy training, education, enlightenment, and political and everyday experience.\nIn the practical questions\nthat arise in the politics\nof any particular or specific historical moment,\nit is important\nto single out those\nwhich display the principal type of intolerable and treacherous compromises,\nsuch as embody an opportunism\nthat is fatal to the revolutionary class,\nand to exert all efforts\nto explain them and combat them.\nDuring the 1914–18 imperialist war\nbetween two groups of equally predatory countries,\nsocial-chauvinism\nwas the principal and fundamental type of opportunism,\ni.e., support of “defense of country”,\nwhich in such a war\nwas really equivalent to defense of the predatory interests\nof one’s “own” bourgeoisie.\nAfter the war,\ndefense of the robber League of Nations,\ndefense of direct or indirect alliances\nwith the bourgeoisie of one’s own country\nagainst the revolutionary proletariat\nand the “Soviet” movement,\nand defense of bourgeois democracy and bourgeois parliamentarianism\nagainst “Soviet power”\nbecame the principal manifestations\nof those intolerable and treacherous compromises,\nwhose sum total constituted an opportunism\nfatal to the revolutionary proletariat and its

pamphlet.\n\nIt is surprising\nthat, with such views,\nthese Lefts\ndo not emphatically condemn Bolshevism!\nAfter all,\nthe German Lefts cannot but know that the entire history of Bolshevism,\nboth before and after the October Revolution,\nis full of instances of changes of tack,\nconciliatory tactics and compromises\nwith other parties,\nincluding bourgeois parties!\n\nTo carry on a war\nfor the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie,\na war which is a hundred times more difficult,\nprotracted and complex\nthan the most stubborn of ordinary wars between states,\nand to renounce in

temporary, unstable, vacillating or conditional allies)—\nis that not ridiculous in the extreme?\nIs it not like making a difficult ascent\nof an unexplored and hitherto inaccessible mountain\nand refusing in advance\never to move in zigzags,\never to retrace one’s steps,\nor ever to abandon a course once selected,\nand to try others?\nAnd yet people so immature and inexperienced\n(\nif youth were the explanation,\nit would not be so bad;\nyoung people are preordained to talk such nonsense\nfor a certain period)\nhave met with support—\nwhether direct or indirect,\nopen or covert, whole or partial,\nit does not matter—\nfrom some members of the Communist Party of Holland.\n\nAfter the first socialist revolution\nof the proletariat,\nand the overthrow of the bourgeoisie in some country,\nthe proletariat of that country\nremains for a long time weaker than the bourgeoisie,\nsimply because of the latter’s extensive international links,\nand also because of the spontaneous and continuous restoration and regeneration of capitalism\nand the bourgeoisie\nby the small commodity producers of the country\nwhich has overthrown the bourgeoisie.\nThe more powerful enemy\ncan be vanquished only\nby exerting the utmost effort,\nand by the most thorough, careful, attentive, skilful and obligatory use of any, even the smallest,\nrift between the enemies,\nany conflict of interests\namong the bourgeoisie\nof the various countries\nand among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie\nwithin the various countries,\nand also by taking advantage of any, even the smallest,\nopportunity of winning a mass ally,\neven though this ally\nis temporary,\nvacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional.\nThose who do not understand this\nreveal a failure\nto understand even the smallest grain of Marxism,\nof modern scientific socialism in general.\nThose who have not proved in practice,\nover a fairly considerable period of time\nand in fairly varied political situations,\ntheir ability to apply this truth in practice\nhave not yet learned\nto help the revolutionary class\nin its struggle\nto emancipate all toiling humanity from the

independent policy,\nbut merely wavered\nbetween the Scheidemanns and the Communists?\n\nOne of the evident reasons\nwas the erroneous tactics\nof the German Communists,\nwho must fearlessly and

there is a fresh, broad, powerful and rapidly growing communist movement among the workers,\nwhich justifies the best hopes.\nThere are several political parties and organizations\n(the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party, the South Wales Socialist Society, the Workers’ Socialist Federation),\nwhich desire to form a Communist Party\nand are already negotiating among themselves\nto this end.\nIn its issue of February 21, 1920, Vol. VI, No. 48, The Workers’ Dreadnought,\nweekly organ of the last of the organizations mentioned,\ncarried an article by the editor, Comrade Sylvia Pankhurst,\nentitled “Towards a Communist Party”.\nThe article outlines the progress of the negotiations\nbetween the four organizations mentioned,\nfor the formation of a united Communist Party,\non the basis of affiliation to the Third International,\nthe recognition of the Soviet system instead of parliamentarianism,\nand the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nIt appears that\none of the greatest obstacles\nto the immediate formation of a united Communist Party\nis presented by the disagreement\non the questions of participation in Parliament\nand on whether the new Communist Party\nshould affiliate to the old,\ntrade-unionist,\nopportunist and social-chauvinist Labour Party,\nwhich is mostly made up of trade unions.\nThe Workers’ Socialist Federation and the Socialist Labour Party\nare opposed to taking part in parliamentary elections and in Parliament,\nand they are opposed to affiliation to the Labour Party;\nin this they disagree with all or with most of the members of the British Socialist Party,\nwhich they regard as the “Right wing of the Communist parties”\nin Great Britain.\n(Page 5, Sylvia Pankhurst’s article.)\n\nThus,\nthe main division is the same as in Germany,\nnotwithstanding the enormous difference in the forms in which the disagreements manifest themselves\n(in Germany the form is far closer to the “Russian”\nthan it is in Great Britain),\nand in a number of other things.\nLet us examine the arguments of the “Lefts”.\n\nOn the question of participation in Parliament,\nComrade Sylvia Pankhurst\nrefers to an article in the same issue,\nby Comrade Gallacher,\nwho writes in the name of the Scottish Workers’ Council in Glasgow.\n<blockquote>“The above council,” he writes,\n“is definitely anti-parliamentarian,\nand has behind it the Left wing\nof the various political bodies.\nWe represent the revolutionary movement in Scotland,\nstriving continually\nto build up a revolutionary organization\nwithin the industries [in various branches of production],\nand a Communist Party,\nbased on social committees, throughout the country.\nFor a considerable time\nwe have been sparring with the official parliamentarians.\nWe have not considered it necessary\nto declare open warfare on them,\nand they are afraid to open an attack on us.\n\n“But this state of affairs\ncannot long continue.\nWe are winning all along the line.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin Left-wing communism, an infantile disorder", "namespace": "Main", "section": null,

from within parliament,\nhelp the masses of the workers\nsee the results of a Henderson and Snowden government in practice,\nand that they should help the Hendersons and Snowdens\ndefeat the united forces of Lloyd George and Churchill.\nTo act otherwise\nwould mean hampering the cause of the revolution,\nsince revolution is impossible\nwithout a change\nin the views of the majority of the working class,\na change brought about by the political experience of the masses,\nnever by propaganda alone.\n“\nTo lead the way without compromises, without turning”—\nthis slogan is obviously wrong\nif it comes from a patently impotent minority\nof the workers\nwho know (or at all events should know)\nthat given a Henderson and Snowden victory\nover Lloyd George and Churchill,\nthe majority will soon become disappointed in their leaders\nand will begin to support communism\n(or at all events will adopt an attitude of neutrality,\nand, in the main, of sympathetic neutrality, towards the Communists).\nIt is as though 10,000 soldiers were to hurl themselves into battle\nagainst an enemy force of 50,000,\nwhen it would be proper to “halt”,\n“take evasive action”,\nor even effect a “compromise”\nso as to gain time\nuntil the arrival of the 100,000 reinforcements\nthat are on their way\nbut cannot go into action immediately.\nThat is intellectualist childishness,\nnot the serious tactics of a revolutionary class.\n\nThe fundamental law of revolution,\nwhich has been confirmed by all revolutions\nand especially by all three Russian revolutions in the twentieth century,\nis as follows:\nfor a revolution to take place\nit is not enough\nfor the exploited and oppressed masses\nto realize the impossibility of living in the old way,\nand demand changes;\nfor a revolution to take place\nit is essential\nthat the exploiters\nshould not be able to live and rule in the old way.\nIt is only when the “lower classes”\ndo not want to live in the old way\nand the “upper classes”\ncannot carry on in the old way that the revolution can triumph.\nThis truth can be expressed in other words:\nrevolution is impossible\nwithout a nation-wide crisis\n(affecting both the exploited and the exploiters).\nIt follows that,\nfor a revolution to take place,\nit is essential,\nfirst,\nthat a majority of the workers\n(or at least a majority of the class-conscious, thinking, and politically active workers)\nshould fully realize that revolution is necessary,\nand that they should be prepared to die for it;\nsecond,\nthat the ruling classes\nshould be going through a governmental crisis,\nwhich draws even the most backward masses into politics\n(symptomatic of any genuine revolution\nis a rapid, tenfold and even hundredfold increase\nin the size of the working and oppressed masses\n—\nhitherto apathetic—\nwho are capable of waging the political struggle),\nweakens the government,\nand makes it possible for the revolutionaries\nto rapidly overthrow it.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin Left-wing communism, an infantile disorder", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 35, "line_range": "3991-4104", "word_count": 739,

doctrinairism to the masses!\nThe masses in Russia\nare no doubt no better educated than the masses in Britain;\nif anything, they are less so.\nYet the masses understood the Bolsheviks,\nand the fact that, in September 1917,\non the eve of the Soviet revolution,\nthe Bolsheviks put up their candidates\nfor a bourgeois parliament (the Constituent Assembly)\nand on the day after the Soviet revolution,\nin November 1917,\ntook part in the elections to this Constituent Assembly,\nwhich they got rid of on January 5, 1918—\nthis did not hamper the Bolsheviks,\nbut, on the contrary, helped them.\n\nI cannot deal here with the second point of disagreement\namong the British Communists—\nthe question of affiliation or non-affiliation to the Labour Party.\nI have too little material at my disposal\non this question,\nwhich is highly complex\nbecause of the unique character\nof the British Labour Party,\nwhose very structure is so unlike that of the political parties usual in the

Communist Party\nmust keep its doctrine pure,\nand its independence of reformism inviolate;\nits mission is to lead the way,\nwithout stopping or turning,\nby the direct road to the communist revolution”—\nwill inevitably fall into error.\nSuch principles are merely a repetition of the mistake\nmade by the French Blanquist Communards,\nwho, in 1874, “repudiated”\nall compromises\nand all intermediate stages.\nSecond,\nit is beyond doubt\nthat, in this question too,\nas always,\nthe task consists in learning\nto apply the general and basic principles of communism\nto the specific

conditions,\nbackward Russia was the first to show the world,\nnot only the growth,\nby leaps and bounds,\nof the independent activity of the oppressed masses\nin time of revolution\n(this had occurred in all great revolutions),\nbut also that the significance of the proletariat\nis infinitely greater than its proportion in the total population;\nit showed a combination of the economic strike and the political strike,\nwith the latter developing into an armed uprising,\nand the birth of the Soviets,\na new form of mass struggle\nand mass organization\nof the classes oppressed by capitalism.\n\nThe revolutions of February and October 1917\nled to the all-round development of the Soviets\non a nation-wide scale\nand to their victory in the proletarian socialist revolution.\nIn

Menshevism,\ni.e., opportunism\nand social-chauvinism\n(the home brand in each particular country),\nand then as a complement, so to say, Left-wing communism.\nThe former struggle has developed in all countries,\napparently without any exception,\nas a duel\nbetween the Second International (already virtually dead)\nand the Third International.\nThe latter struggle is to be seen in Germany, Great Britain, Italy,\nAmerica (at any rate,\na certain section of the Industrial Workers of the World\nand of the anarcho-syndicalist trends\nuphold the errors of Left-wing communism\nalongside of an almost universal\nand almost unreserved acceptance of the Soviet system),\nand in France\n(the attitude of a section of the former syndicalists\ntowards the political party and

scale.\n\nBut while the working-class movement\nis everywhere going through\nwhat is actually the same kind of preparatory school\nfor victory over the bourgeoisie,\nit is achieving that development\nin its own way in each country.\nThe big and advanced capitalist countries\nare travelling this road\nfar more rapidly\nthan did Bolshevism,\nto which history granted fifteen years\nto prepare itself for victory,\nas an organized political trend.\nIn the brief space of a year,\nthe Third International\nhas already scored a decisive victory;\nit has defeated the yellow, social-chauvinist Second International,\nwhich only a few months ago\nwas incomparably stronger than the Third International,\nseemed stable and powerful,\nand enjoyed every possible support—\ndirect and indirect,\nmaterial (Cabinet posts, passports, the press)\nand ideological—\nfrom the world bourgeoisie.\n\nIt is now essential\nthat Communists of every country\nshould quite consciously take

really centralized and really leading centre\ncapable of directing the international tactics\nof the revolutionary proletariat\nin its struggle for a world Soviet republic.\nIt should be clearly

particulars,\ncorrectly adapt and apply them\nto national and national-state distinctions.\nTo seek out, investigate, predict, and grasp that which is nationally specific\nand nationally

this,\nnot even the first step towards victory\ncan be made.\nBut that is still quite a long way from victory.\nVictory cannot be won with a vanguard alone.\nTo throw only the vanguard\ninto the decisive battle,\nbefore the entire class,\nthe broad masses,\nhave taken up a position\neither of direct support for the vanguard,\nor at least of sympathetic neutrality towards it\nand of precluded support for the enemy,\nwould be, not merely foolish but criminal.\nPropaganda and agitation alone\nare not enough for an entire class,\nthe broad masses of the working people,\nthose oppressed by capital,\nto take up such a stand.\nFor that,\nthe masses must have their own political experience.\nSuch is the fundamental law of all great revolutions,\nwhich has been confirmed with compelling force and vividness,\nnot only in Russia but in Germany as well.\nTo turn resolutely towards communism,\nit was necessary,\nnot only for the ignorant and often illiterate masses of Russia,\nbut also for the literate and well-educated masses of Germany,\nto realize\nfrom their own bitter experience\nthe absolute impotence and spinelessness,\nthe absolute helplessness and servility to the bourgeoisie,\nand the utter vileness of the government of the paladins of the Second International;\nthey had to realize\nthat a dictatorship of the extreme reactionaries\n(Kornilov in Russia; Kapp and Co. in Germany)\nis inevitably the only alternative\nto a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nThe immediate objective\nof the class-conscious vanguard\nof the international working-class movement,\ni.e., the Communist parties, groups and trends,\nis to be able to lead the broad masses\n(who are still, for the most part,\napathetic, inert, dormant and convention-ridden)\nto their new position,\nor, rather, to be able to lead,\nnot only their own party\nbut also these masses\nin their advance\nand transition to the new position.\nWhile the first historical objective\n(that of winning over the class-conscious vanguard\nof the proletariat\nto the side of Soviet power\nand the dictatorship of the working class)\ncould not have been reached\nwithout a complete ideological and political victory\nover opportunism\nand social-chauvinism,\nthe second and immediate objective,\nwhich consists in being able to lead the masses\nto a new position\nensuring the victory of the vanguard in the revolution,\ncannot be reached without the liquidation of Left doctrinairism,\nand without a full elimination of its errors.\n\nAs long as it was (and inasmuch as it still is)\na question of winning the proletariat’s vanguard\nover to the side of communism,\npriority went and still goes to propaganda work;\neven propaganda circles,\nwith all their parochial limitations,\nare useful under these conditions,\nand produce good results.\nBut when it is a question of practical action\nby the masses,\nof the disposition,\nif one may so put it,\nof vast armies,\nof the alignment of all the class forces in a given society\nfor the final and decisive battle,\nthen propagandist methods alone,\nthe mere repetition of the truths of “pure” communism,\nare of no avail.\nIn these circumstances,\none must not count in thousands,\nlike the propagandist\nbelonging to a small group\nthat has not yet given leadership to the masses;\nin these circumstances\none must count in millions and tens of millions.\nIn these circumstances,\nwe must ask ourselves,\nnot only whether we have convinced the vanguard of the revolutionary class,\nbut also whether the historically effective forces of all classes\n—\npositively of all the classes in a given society, without exception—\nare arrayed in such a way that the decisive battle is at hand—\nin such a way that:\n(1) all the class forces hostile to us\nhave become sufficiently entangled,\nare sufficiently at loggerheads with each other,\nhave sufficiently weakened themselves in a struggle\nwhich is beyond their strength;\n(2)\nall the vacillating and unstable,\nintermediate elements—\nthe petty bourgeoisie\nand the petty-bourgeois democrats,\nas distinct from the bourgeoisie—\nhave sufficiently exposed

struggle\nare opportunist\nbecause, in this field,\nthe bourgeoisie\nhas most frequently deceived\nand duped the workers\n(particularly in “peaceful” and non-revolutionary times),\nwhile illegal methods of struggle are revolutionary.\nThat, however, is wrong.\nThe truth is that\nthose parties and leaders\nare opportunists\nand traitors\nto the working class\nthat are unable or unwilling\n(do not say, “I can’t”;\nsay, “I shan’t”)\nto use illegal methods of struggle\nin conditions\nsuch as those which prevailed,\nfor example,\nduring the imperialist war of 1914–18,\nwhen the bourgeoisie\nof the freest democratic countries\nmost brazenly and brutally deceived the workers,\nand smothered the truth\nabout the predatory character of the war.\nBut revolutionaries who are incapable of combining illegal forms of struggle\nwith every form of legal struggle\nare poor revolutionaries indeed.\nIt is not difficult to be a revolutionary\nwhen revolution has already broken out\nand is in

almost to the point of frenzy,\nand for that very reason it is,\non the one hand,\nprecipitating the progress of events and, on the other,\nconcentrating on the forcible suppression of Bolshevism,\nthereby weakening its own position\nin a number of other fields.\nIn their tactics\nthe Communists in all the advanced countries\nmust take both these circumstances\ninto account.\n\nWhen the Russian Cadets and Kerensky began furiously to hound the Bolsheviks—\nespecially since April 1917,\nand more particularly in June and July 1917—\nthey overdid things.\nMillions of copies of bourgeois papers,\nclamouring in every key against the Bolsheviks,\nhelped the masses\nto make an appraisal of Bolshevism;\napart from the newspapers,\nall public life\nwas full of discussions\nabout Bolshevism,\nas a result of the bourgeoisie’s “zeal”.\nToday the millionaires of all countries\nare behaving\non an international scale\nin a way that deserves our heartiest thanks.\nThey are hounding Bolshevism\nwith the same zeal as Kerensky and Co. did;\nthey, too,\nare overdoing things and helping us\njust as Kerensky did.\nWhen the French bourgeoisie\nmakes Bolshevism the central issue in the elections,\nand accuses the comparatively moderate or vacillating socialists\nof being Bolsheviks;\nwhen the American bourgeoisie,\nwhich has completely lost its head,\nseizes thousands and thousands of people\non suspicion of Bolshevism,\ncreates an atmosphere of panic,\nand broadcasts stories of Bolshevik plots;\nwhen, despite all its wisdom and experience,\nthe British bourgeoisie—\nthe most “solid” in the world—\nmakes incredible blunders,\nfounds richly endowed “anti-Bolshevik societies”,\ncreates a special literature on Bolshevism,\nand recruits an extra number of scientists,\nagitators and clergymen\nto combat it,\nwe must salute and thank the capitalists.\nThey are working for us.\nThey are helping us\nto get the masses\ninterested in the essence and significance of Bolshevism,\nand they cannot do otherwise,\nfor they have already failed\nto ignore Bolshevism\nand stifle it.\n\nBut at the same time,\nthe bourgeoisie sees practically only one aspect of Bolshevism—insurrection, violence, and terror;\nit therefore strives to prepare itself for resistance and opposition primarily in this field.\nIt is possible that, in certain instances, in certain countries,\nand for certain brief periods,\nit will succeed in this.\nWe must reckon with such an eventuality,\nand we have absolutely nothing to fear if it does succeed.\nCommunism is emerging in positively every sphere of public life;\nits beginnings\nare to be seen literally on all sides.\nThe “contagion”\n(to use the favourite metaphor of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois police,\nthe one mostly to their liking)\nhas very thoroughly penetrated the organism\nand has completely permeated it.\nIf special efforts are made to block one of the channels,\nthe “contagion”\nwill find another one, sometimes very unexpectedly.\nLife will assert itself.\nLet the bourgeoisie rave,\nwork itself into a frenzy,\ngo to extremes,\ncommit follies,\ntake vengeance on the Bolsheviks in advance,\nand endeavour to kill off\n(as in India, Hungary, Germany, etc.)\nmore hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of yesterday’s and tomorrow’s Bolsheviks.\nIn acting thus,\nthe bourgeoisie\nis acting as all historically doomed classes\nhave done.\nCommunists should know that,\nin any case,\nthe future belongs to them;\ntherefore,\nwe can (and must)\ncombine the most intense passion\nin the great revolutionary struggle,\nwith the coolest and most sober appraisal\nof the frenzied ravings of the bourgeoisie.\nThe Russian revolution was cruelly defeated in 1905;\nthe Russian Bolsheviks were defeated in July 1917;\nover 15,000 German Communists were killed\nas a result of the wily provocation and cunning maneuvers\nof Scheidemann and Noske,\nwho were working hand in glove with the bourgeoisie\nand the monarchist generals;\nWhite terror is raging in Finland and Hungary.\nBut in all cases in all countries,\ncommunism is becoming steeled and is growing;\nits roots are so deep\nthat persecution\ndoes not weaken\nor debilitate it\nbut only strengthens it.\nOnly one thing is lacking\nto enable us\nto march forward more confidently and firmly to victory,\nnamely,\nthe universal and thorough awareness\nof all Communists\nin all countries\nof the necessity\nto display the utmost flexibility\nin their tactics.\nThe communist movement,\nwhich is developing magnificently,\nnow lacks, especially in the advanced countries,\nthis awareness and the ability\nto apply it in practice.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin Left-wing communism, an

{"chunk_id": "Main/Library_Vladimir_Lenin_Left-wing_communism,_an_infantile_disorder#45", "text": "That which happened to such leaders of the Second International,\nsuch highly erudite Marxists\ndevoted to socialism\nas Kautsky, Otto Bauer and others,\ncould (and should)\nprovide a useful lesson.\nThey fully appreciated the need for flexible tactics;\nthey themselves learned Marxist dialectic\nand taught it to others\n(and much of what they have done in this field\nwill always remain a valuable contribution to socialist literature);\nhowever,\nin the application of this dialectic they committed such an error,\nor proved to be so undialectical in practice,\nso incapable of taking into account the rapid change of forms\nand the rapid acquisition\nof new content\nby the old forms,\nthat their fate is not much more enviable\nthan that of Hyndman, Guesde and Plekhanov.\nThe principal reason for their bankruptcy\nwas\nthat they were hypnotized\nby a definite form of growth\nof the working-class movement and socialism,\nforgot all about the one-sidedness of that form,\nwere afraid to see the break-up\nwhich objective conditions made inevitable,\nand continued to repeat simple and, at first glance,\nincontestable axioms\nthat had been learned by rote, like: “three is more than two”.\nBut politics is more like algebra\nthan like arithmetic,\nand still more like higher than elementary mathematics.\nIn reality,\nall the old forms of the socialist movement\nhave acquired a new content,\nand, consequently, a new symbol,\nthe “minus” sign,\nhas appeared in front of all the figures;\nour wiseacres, however,\nhave stubbornly continued (and still continue)\nto persuade themselves and others\nthat “minus three” is more than “minus two”.\n\nWe must see to it that Communists do not make a similar mistake,\nonly in the opposite sense,\nor rather, we must see to it that a similar mistake,\nonly made in the opposite sense by the “Left” Communists,\nis corrected as soon as possible\nand eliminated as rapidly and painlessly as possible.\nIt is not only Right doctrinairism that is erroneous;\nLeft doctrinairism is erroneous too.\nOf course,\nthe mistake of Left doctrinairism in communism\nis at present a thousand times less dangerous\nand less significant\nthan that of Right doctrinairism\n(i.e., social-chauvinism and Kautskyism);\nbut, after all, that is only due to the fact that Left communism\nis a very young trend,\nis only just coming into being.\nIt is only for this reason\nthat, under certain conditions,\nthe disease can be easily eradicated,\nand we must set to work with the utmost energy\nto eradicate it.\n\nThe old forms burst asunder,\nfor it turned out\nthat their new content—\nanti-proletarian and reactionary—\nhad attained an inordinate development.\nFrom the standpoint of the development of international communism,\nour work today\nhas such a durable and powerful content\n(for Soviet power and the dictatorship of the proletariat)\nthat it can and must manifest itself in any form,\nboth new and old;\nit can and must regenerate,\nconquer and subjugate all forms,\nnot only the new, but also the old—\nnot for the purpose of reconciling itself with the old,\nbut for the purpose of making all and every form—\nnew and old—\na weapon for the complete and irrevocable victory of communism.\n\nThe Communists\nmust exert every effort\nto direct the working-class movement\nand social development\nin general\nalong the straightest and shortest road\nto the victory of Soviet power\nand the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world-wide scale.\nThat is an incontestable truth.\nBut it is enough to take one little step farther—\na step that might seem to be in the same direction—\nand truth turns into error.\nWe have only to say,\nas the German and British Left Communists do,\nthat we recognize only one road,\nonly the direct road,\nand that we will not permit tacking,\nconciliatory maneuvers, or compromising—\nand it will be a mistake\nwhich may cause,\nand in part has already caused and is causing,\nvery grave prejudices to communism.\nRight doctrinairism persisted in recognizing only the old forms,\nand became utterly bankrupt,\nfor it did not notice the new content.\nLeft doctrinairism persists in the unconditional repudiation\nof certain old forms,\nfailing to see that the new content\nis forcing its way through all and sundry forms,\nthat it is our duty as Communists\nto master all forms,\nto learn how,\nwith the maximum rapidity,\nto supplement one form with another,\nto substitute one for another,\nand to adapt our tactics\nto any such change\nthat does not come from our class or from our efforts.", "article_title": "Library
