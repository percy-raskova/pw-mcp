{"chunk_id": "Main/Library_Vladimir_Lenin_The_state_and_revolution#1", "text": "Summing up his historical analysis,\nEngels says:\n<blockquote>“\nThe state is, therefore, by no means a power forced on society from without;\njust as little is it ’the reality of the ethical idea’,\n’the image and reality of reason’,\nas Hegel maintains.\nRather, it is a product of society\nat a certain stage of development;\nit is the admission that this society\nhas become entangled\nin an insoluble\ncontradiction with itself,\nthat it has split into irreconcilable\nantagonisms\nwhich it is powerless to dispel.\nBut in order that these antagonisms,\nthese classes with conflicting economic interests,\nmight not consume themselves and society\nin fruitless struggle,\nit became necessary\nto have a power, seemingly standing above society,\nthat would alleviate the conflict\nand keep it within the bounds of ’order’;\nand this power,\narisen out of society\nbut placing itself above it,\nand alienating itself more and more from it,\nis the state.\n”</blockquote>\nThis expresses with perfect clarity\nthe basic idea of Marxism\nwith regard to the historical role\nand the meaning of the state.\nThe state is a product and a manifestation of the irreconcilability\nof class antagonisms.\nThe state arises\nwhere, when and insofar\nas class antagonism objectively\ncannot be reconciled.\nAnd, conversely,\nthe existence of the state proves\nthat the class antagonisms are irreconcilable.\n\nIt is on this most important and fundamental point\nthat the distortion of Marxism,\nproceeding along two main lines, begins.\n\nOn the one hand, the bourgeois,\nand particularly the petty-bourgeois,\nideologists,\ncompelled under the weight of indisputable historical facts\nto admit that the state only exists\nwhere there are class antagonisms\nand a class struggle,\n“correct” Marx in such a way as to make it appear\nthat the state is an organ for the reconciliation of classes.\nAccording to Marx,\nthe state could neither have arisen\nnor maintained itself\nhad it been possible\nto reconcile classes.\nFrom what the petty-bourgeois and philistine professors\nand publicists\nsay,\nwith quite frequent and benevolent references to Marx,\nit appears that the state does reconcile classes.\nAccording to Marx,\nthe state is an organ of class rule,\nan organ for the oppression of one class by another;\nit is the creation of “order”,\nwhich legalizes\nand perpetuates this oppression\nby moderating the conflict between classes.\nIn the opinion of the petty-bourgeois politicians,\nhowever, order means the reconciliation of classes,\nand not the oppression of one class by another;\nto alleviate the conflict\nmeans reconciling classes\nand not depriving the oppressed classes\nof definite means and methods of struggle\nto overthrow the oppressors.\n\nFor instance,\nwhen, in the revolution of 1917,\nthe question of the significance and role of the state\narose\nin all its magnitude\nas a practical question\ndemanding immediate action,\nand, moreover, action on a mass scale,\nall the Social-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks\ndescended at once to the petty-bourgeois theory\nthat the “state” “reconciles” classes.\nInnumerable resolutions and articles by politicians\nof both these parties\nare thoroughly saturated with this petty-bourgeois and philistine “reconciliation” theory.\nThat the state is an organ of the rule of a definite class\nwhich cannot be reconciled\nwith its antipode (the class opposite to it)\nis something the petty-bourgeois democrats\nwill never be able to understand.\nTheir attitude to the state\nis one of the most striking manifestations\nof the fact that our Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are not socialists at all\n(a point that we Bolsheviks have always maintained),\nbut petty-bourgeois democrats\nusing near-socialist phraseology.\n\nOn the other hand,\nthe “Kautskyite” distortion of Marxism\nis far more subtle.\n“Theoretically”,\nit is not denied\nthat the state is an organ of class rule,\nor that class antagonisms\nare irreconcilable.\nBut what is overlooked\nor glossed over is this:\nif the state is the product of the irreconcilability\nof class antagonisms,\nif it is a power standing above society\nand “alienating itself more and more from it”,\nit is clear\nthat the liberation of the oppressed class\nis impossible\nnot only without a violent revolution,\nbut also without the destruction of the apparatus of state power\nwhich was created by the ruling class\nand which is the embodiment of this “alienation”.\nAs we shall see later,\nMarx very explicitly drew this theoretically self-evident conclusion\non the strength of a concrete historical analysis\nof the tasks of the revolution.\nAnd — as we shall show in detail further on —\nit is this conclusion\nwhich Kautsky has “forgotten”\nand distorted.",

it\nand alienates itself more and more from it.\nWhat does this power mainly consist of?\nIt consists of special bodies of armed men having prisons, etc., at their command.\n\nWe are justified\nin speaking of special bodies of armed men,\nbecause the public power\nwhich is an attribute of every state “does not directly coincide”\nwith the armed population,\nwith its “self-acting armed organization”.\n\nLike all great revolutionary thinkers,\nEngels tries to draw the attention\nof the class-conscious workers\nto what prevailing philistinism\nregards\nas least worthy of attention,\nas the most habitual thing,\nhallowed by prejudices\nthat are not only deep-rooted but, one might say, petrified.\nA standing army and police\nare the chief instruments of state power.\nBut how can it be otherwise?\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the vast majority of Europeans\nof the end of the 19th century,\nwhom Engels was addressing,\nand who had not gone through or closely observed a single great revolution,\nit could not have been otherwise.\nThey could not understand at all\nwhat a “self-acting armed organization of the population” was.\nWhen asked why it became necessary\nto have special bodies of armed men placed above society\nand alienating themselves from it (police and a standing army),\nthe West-European and Russian philistines\nare inclined to utter a few phrases\nborrowed from Spencer or Mikhailovsky,\nto refer to the growing complexity of social life,\nthe differentiation of functions,\nand so on.\n\nSuch a reference seems “scientific”,\nand effectively lulls the ordinary person to sleep\nby obscuring the important and basic fact,\nnamely, the split of society\ninto irreconcilable antagonistic classes.\n\nWere it not for this split,\nthe “self-acting armed organization of the population”\nwould differ\nfrom the primitive organization\nof a stick-wielding herd of monkeys,\nor of primitive men,\nor of men united in clans,\nby its complexity,\nits high technical level,\nand so on.\nBut such an organization\nwould still be possible.\n\nIt is impossible\nbecause civilized society\nis split into antagonistic,\nand, moreover,\nirreconcilably antagonistic classes,\nwhose “self-acting” arming\nwould lead to an armed struggle between them.\nA state arises,\na special power is created,\nspecial bodies of armed men,\nand every revolution,\nby destroying the state apparatus,\nshows us the naked class struggle,\nclearly shows us\nhow the ruling class\nstrives\nto restore the special bodies of armed men\nwhich serve it,\nand how the oppressed class strives\nto create a new organization of this kind,\ncapable of serving the exploited\ninstead of the exploiters.\n\nIn the above argument,\nEngels raises theoretically the very same question\nwhich every great revolution raises before us in practice,\npalpably and, what is more,\non a scale of mass action,\nnamely, the question of the relationship\nbetween “special” bodies of armed men\nand the “self-acting armed organization of the population”.\nWe shall see how this question is specifically illustrated by the experience\nof the

state\nare so widely known,\nthey are often quoted,\nand so clearly reveal the essence\nof the customary adaptation of Marxism\nto opportunism\nthat we must deal with them in detail.\nWe shall quote the whole argument\nfrom which they are taken.\n<blockquote>“\nThe proletariat seizes from state power\nand turns the means of production into state property\nto begin with.\nBut thereby it abolishes itself\nas the proletariat,\nabolishes all class distinctions\nand class antagonisms,\nand abolishes also the state as state.\nSociety thus far,\noperating amid class antagonisms,\nneeded the state,\nthat is,\nan organization of the particular exploiting class,\nfor the maintenance of its external conditions of production,\nand, therefore, especially,\nfor the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class\nin the conditions of oppression\ndetermined by the given mode of production\n(slavery, serfdom or bondage, wage-labor).\nThe state was the official representative of society as a whole,\nits concentration in a visible corporation.\nBut it was this only insofar\nas it was the state of that class\nwhich itself represented,\nfor its own time,\nsociety as a whole:\nin ancient times,\nthe state of slave-owning citizens;\nin the Middle Ages,\nof the feudal nobility;\nin our own time,\nof the bourgeoisie.\nWhen at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society,\nit renders itself unnecessary.\nAs soon as there is no longer any social class\nto be held in subjection,\nas soon as class rule,\nand the individual struggle for existence\nbased upon the present anarchy in production,\nwith the collisions and excesses\narising from this struggle,\nare removed,\nnothing more remains to be held in subjection —\nnothing necessitating a special coercive force,\na state.\nThe first act by which the state really comes forward\nas the representative of the whole of society —\nthe taking possession of the means of production\nin the name of society —\nis also its last independent act as a state.\nState interference in social relations\nbecomes, in one domain after another, superfluous,\nand then dies down of itself.\nThe government of persons\nis replaced by the administration of things,\nand by the conduct of processes of production.\nThe state is not ’abolished’.\nIt withers away.\nThis gives the measure of the value of the phrase ’a free people’s state’,\nboth as to its justifiable use\nfor a long time\nfrom an agitational point of view,\nand as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency;\nand also of the so-called anarchists’ demand that the state be abolished overnight.\n”</blockquote>\nIt is safe to say that of this argument of Engels’,\nwhich is so remarkably rich in ideas,\nonly one point has become an integral part of socialist thought\namong modern socialist parties,\nnamely,\nthat according to Marx\nthat state “withers away”\n—\nas distinct from the anarchist doctrine\nof the “abolition” of the state.\nTo prune Marxism to such an extent\nmeans reducing it to opportunism,\nfor this “interpretation”\nonly leaves a vague notion\nof a slow, even, gradual change,\nof absence of leaps and storms,\nof absence of revolution.\nThe current, widespread, popular, if one may say so,\nconception of the “withering away”\nof the state undoubtedly\nmeans obscuring,\nif not repudiating, revolution.\n\nSuch an “interpretation”, however,\nis the crudest distortion of Marxism,\nadvantageous only to the bourgeoisie.\nIn point of theory,\nit is based on disregard\nfor the most important circumstances\nand considerations\nindicated in, say, Engels’ “summary” argument\nwe have just quoted in full.\n\nIn the first place,\nat the very outset of his argument,\nEngels says that, in seizing state power,\nthe proletariat thereby “abolishes the state as state”.\nIt is not done to ponder over the meaning of this.\nGenerally,\nit is either ignored altogether,\nor is considered to be something in the nature of “Hegelian weakness”\non Engels’ part.\nAs a matter of fact,\nhowever,\nthese words briefly express the experience\nof one of the greatest proletarian revolutions,\nthe Paris Commune of 1871,\nof which we shall speak in greater detail\nin its proper place.\nAs a matter of fact,\nEngels speaks here of the proletariat revolution “abolishing” the bourgeois state,\nwhile the words about the state withering away\nrefer to the remnants of the proletarian state\nafter the socialist revolution.\nAccording to Engels,\nthe bourgeois state does not “wither away”,\nbut is “abolished”\nby the proletariat in the course of the revolution.\nWhat withers away after this revolution\nis the proletarian state or semi-state.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution",

{"chunk_id": "Main/Library_Vladimir_Lenin_The_state_and_revolution#7", "text": "Secondly,\nthe state is a “special coercive force”.\nEngels gives this splendid and extremely profound definition\nhere with the utmost lucidity.\nAnd from it follows\nthat the “special coercive force”\nfor the suppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie,\nof millions of working people by handfuls of the rich,\nmust be replaced by a “special coercive force”\nfor the suppression of the bourgeoisie\nby the proletariat (the dictatorship of the proletariat).\nThis is precisely what is meant by “abolition of the state as state”.\nThis is precisely the “act”\nof taking possession of the means of production in the name of society.\nAnd it is self-evident\nthat such a replacement of one (bourgeois) “special force”\nby another (proletarian) “special force”\ncannot possibly take place\nin the form of “withering away”.\n\nThirdly,\nin speaking of the state “withering away”,\nand the even more graphic and colorful “dying down of itself”,\nEngels refers quite clearly and definitely to the period\nafter “the state has taken possession of the means of production\nin the name of the whole of society”,\nthat is, after the socialist revolution.\nWe all know that the political form of the “state”\nat that time\nis the most complete democracy.\nBut it never enters the head of any of the opportunists,\nwho shamelessly distort Marxism,\nthat Engels is consequently speaking here of democracy “dying down of itself”,\nor “withering away”.\nThis seems very strange at first sight.\nBut it is “incomprehensible”\nonly to those who have not thought about democracy\nalso being a state\nand, consequently, also disappearing when the state disappears.\nRevolution alone can “abolish” the bourgeois state.\nThe state in general, i.e., the most complete democracy,\ncan only “wither away”.\n\nFourthly,\nafter formulating his famous proposition\nthat “the state withers away”,\nEngels at once explains specifically that this proposition is directed against both the opportunists and the anarchists.\nIn doing this,\nEngels puts in the forefront\nthat conclusion,\ndrawn from the proposition that “the state withers away”,\nwhich is directed against the opportunists.\n\nOne can wager that out of every 10,000 persons who have read or heard about the “withering away”\nof the state,\n9,990 are completely unaware,\nor do not remember,\nthat Engels directed his conclusions\nfrom that proposition not against anarchists alone.\nAnd of the remaining 10, probably nine do not know the meaning of a “free people’s state”\nor why an attack on this slogan\nmeans an attack on opportunists.\nThis is how history is written!\nThis is how a great revolutionary teaching\nis imperceptibly falsified\nand adapted to prevailing philistinism.\nThe conclusion directed against the anarchists\nhas been repeated thousands of times;\nit has been vulgarized,\nand rammed into people’s heads\nin the shallowest form,\nand has acquired the strength of a prejudice,\nwhereas the conclusion directed against the opportunists\nhas been obscured\nand “forgotten”!\n\nThe “free people’s state”\nwas a programme demand and a catchword current\namong the German Social-Democrats in the seventies.\nThis catchword is devoid of all political content\nexcept that it describes the concept of democracy\nin a pompous philistine fashion.\nInsofar as it hinted in a legally permissible manner\nat a democratic republic,\nEngels was prepared to “justify” its use “for a time”\nfrom an agitational point of view.\nBut it was an opportunist catchword,\nfor it amounted to nothing more than prettifying bourgeois democracy,\nand was also a failure\nto understand the socialist criticism of the state in general.\nWe are in favor of a democratic republic\nas the best form of state\nfor the proletariat under capitalism.\nBut we have no right to forget that wage slavery\nis the lot of the people\neven in the most democratic bourgeois republic.\nFurthermore,\nevery state is a “special force”\nfor the suppression of the oppressed class.\nConsequently,\nevery state is not “free”\nand not a “people’s state”.\nMarx and Engels explained this repeatedly\nto their party comrades in the seventies.\n\nFifthly,\nthe same work of Engels’,\nwhose arguments about the withering away\nof the state everyone remembers,\nalso contains an argument\nof the significance of violent revolution.\nEngels’ historical analysis\nof its role\nbecomes a veritable panegyric on violent revolution.\nThis, “no one remembers”.\nIt is not done in modern socialist parties\nto talk or even think about the significance of this idea,\nand it plays no part whatever in their daily propaganda and agitation among the people.\nAnd yet it is inseparably bound up with the ”withering away”\nof the state\ninto one harmonious whole.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace":

Social-Democrats\nbetween 1878 and 1894,\ni.e.,\nright up to the time of his death,\nbe combined with the theory of the “withering away”\nof the state\nto form a single theory?\n\nUsually the two are combined by means of eclecticism,\nby an unprincipled or sophistic selection\nmade arbitrarily (or to please the powers that be) of first one,\nthen another argument,\nand in 99 cases out of 100, if not more,\nit is the idea of the “withering away”\nthat is placed in the forefront.\nDialectics are replaced by eclecticism —\nthis is the most usual,\nthe most wide-spread practice\nto be met with in present-day official Social-Democratic literature\nin relation to Marxism.\nThis sort of substitution is, of course, nothing new;\nit was observed even in the history of classical Greek

the bourgeois state.\nThe latter cannot be superseded\nby the proletarian state\n(the dictatorship of the proletariat)\nthrough the process of ”withering away”,\nbut, as a general rule, only through a violent revolution.\nThe panegyric Engels sang in its honor,\nand which fully corresponds to Marx’s repeated statements\n(see the concluding passages of The poverty of philosophy\nand the Communist Manifesto\nwith their proud and open proclamation\nof the inevitability of a violent revolution;\nsee what Marx wrote nearly 30 years later,\nin criticizing the Gotha Programme of 1875,\nwhen he mercilessly castigated the opportunist character of that programme)\n—\nthis panegyric is by no means a mere “impulse”,\na mere declamation or a polemical sally.\nThe necessity of systematically imbuing the masses\nwith this and precisely this view of violent revolution\nlies at the root of the entire theory of Marx and Engels.\nThe betrayal of their theory\nby the now prevailing social-chauvinist and Kautskyite trends\nexpresses itself strikingly\nin both these trends\nignoring such propaganda and agitation.\n\nThe supersession of the bourgeois state\nby the proletarian state\nis impossible\nwithout a violent revolution.\nThe abolition of the proletarian state,\ni.e., of the state in general,\nis impossible\nexcept through the process of “withering away”.\n\nA detailed and concrete elaboration of these views\nwas given by Marx and Engels\nwhen they studied each particular revolutionary situation,\nwhen they analyzed the lessons of the experience of each

the Communist Manifesto —\nappeared just on the eve of the revolution of 1848.\nFor this reason,\nin addition to presenting the general principles of Marxism,\nthey reflect to a certain degree\nthe concrete revolutionary situation of the time.\nIt will, therefore, be more expedient,\nperhaps,\nto examine what the authors of these works\nsaid about the state immediately before they drew conclusions\nfrom the experience of the years 1848-51.\n\nIn The Poverty of Philosophy,\nMarx wrote:\n<blockquote>“The working class,\nin the course of development,\nwill substitute for the old bourgeois society\nan association\nwhich will preclude classes\nand their antagonism,\nand there will be no more political power groups,\nsince the political power\nis precisely the official expression of class antagonism in bourgeois society.\n“ <sup>[link to citation needed]</sup></blockquote>\nIt is instructive\nto compare this general exposition\nof the idea of the state disappearing\nafter the abolition of classes\nwith the exposition\ncontained in the Communist Manifesto,\nwritten by Marx and Engels a few months later —\nin November 1847,\nto be exact:\n<blockquote>“...\nIn depicting the most general phases\nof the development\nof the proletariat,\nwe traced the more or less veiled civil war,\nraging within existing society\nup to the point where that war\nbreaks out into open revolution,\nand where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie\nlays the foundation\nfor the sway of the proletariat...\n\n“...\nWe have seen above that the first step in the revolution\nby the working class\nis to raise the proletariat\nto the position of the ruling class\nto win the battle of democracy.\n\n“The proletariat will use its political supremacy\nto wrest, by degree,\nall capital from the bourgeoisie,\nto centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state,\ni.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class;\nand to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.\n” <sup>[link to citation needed]</sup></blockquote>\nHere we have a formulation of one of the most remarkable and most important ideas of Marxism\non the subject of the state,\nnamely, the idea of the “dictatorship of the proletariat“\n(as Marx and Engels began to call it after the Paris Commune);\nand, also, a highly interesting definition of the state,\nwhich is also one of the “forgotten words“ of Marxism:\n“the state, i.e., the proletariat organized as the ruling class.\n“\n\nThis definition of the state\nhas never been explained\nin the prevailing propaganda and agitation literature\nof the official Social-Democratic parties.\nMore than that,\nit has been deliberately ignored,\nfor it is absolutely irreconcilable\nwith reformism,\nand is a slap in the face\nfor the common opportunist prejudices\nand philistine illusions\nabout the “peaceful development of democracy“.\n\nThe proletariat needs the state —\nthis is repeated by all the opportunists,\nsocial-chauvinists and Kautskyites,\nwho assure us that this is what Marx taught.\nBut they “forget”\nto add that,\nin the first place, according to Marx,\nthe proletariat needs only a state\nwhich is withering away, i.e., a state so constituted that it begins to wither away immediately,\nand cannot but wither away.\nAnd, secondly, the working people need a “state, i.e., the proletariat organized as the ruling class“.\n\nThe state is a special organization of force:\nit is an organization of violence\nfor the suppression of some class.\nWhat class must the proletariat suppress?\nNaturally,\nonly the exploiting class, i.e., the bourgeoisie.\nThe working people need the state only to suppress the resistance of the exploiters,\nand only the proletariat can direct this suppression,\ncan carry it out.\nFor the proletariat is the only class that is consistently revolutionary,\nthe only class that can unite all the working and exploited people\nin the struggle against the bourgeoisie,\nin completely removing it.\n\nThe exploiting classes\nneed political rule\nto maintain exploitation,\ni.e.,\nin the selfish

its work methodically.\nBy December 2, 1851 [the day of Louis Bonaparte's coup d'etat],\nit had completed one half of its preparatory work.\nIt is now completing the other half.\nFirst it perfected the parliamentary power,\nin order to be able to overthrow it.\nNow that it has attained this,\nit is perfecting the executive power,\nreducing it to its purest expression,\nisolating it,\nsetting it up against itself\nas the sole object,\nin order to concentrate all its forces of destruction against it.\nAnd when it has done this second half of its preliminary work,\nEurope will leap from its seat\nand exultantly exclaim:\nwell grubbed, old mole!\n\n“\nThis executive power\nwith its enormous bureaucratic and military organization,\nwith its vast and ingenious state machinery,\nwith a host of officials numbering half a million,\nbesides an army of another half million,\nthis appalling parasitic body,\nwhich enmeshes the body of French society\nand chokes all its pores,\nsprang up in the days of the absolute monarchy,\nwith the decay of the feudal system,\nwhich it helped to hasten.\n”\nThe first French Revolution\ndeveloped centralization,\n“but at the same time”\nit increased “the extent, the attributes and the number of agents of governmental power.\nNapoleon completed this state machinery”.\nThe legitimate monarchy\nand the July monarchy “added nothing but a greater division of labor”....\n\n“...\nFinally,\nin its struggle against the revolution,\nthe parliamentary republic found itself compelled to strengthen,\nalong with repressive measures,\nthe resources and centralization of governmental power.\nAll revolutions perfected this machine\ninstead of smashing it.\nThe parties that contended in turn for domination\nregarded the possession of this huge state edifice\nas the principal spoils of the victor.\n” <sup>[link to citation needed]</sup></blockquote>\nIn this remarkable argument,\nMarxism takes a tremendous step forward\ncompared with the Communist

treated in a concrete manner,\nand the conclusion is extremely precise,\ndefinite, practical and palpable:\nall previous revolutions perfected the state machine,\nwhereas it must be broken,\nsmashed.\n\nThis conclusion\nis the chief and fundamental point\nin the Marxist theory of the state.\nAnd it is precisely this fundamental point\nwhich has been completely ignored\nby the dominant official Social-Democratic parties\nand, indeed, distorted (as we shall see later)\nby the foremost theoretician\nof the Second International, Karl Kautsky.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto\ngives a general summary of history,\nwhich compels us to regard the state\nas the organ of class rule\nand leads us to the inevitable conclusion\nthat the proletariat cannot overthrow the bourgeoisie\nwithout first winning political power,\nwithout attaining political supremacy,\nwithout transforming the state\ninto the “proletariat organized as the ruling class”;\nand that this proletarian state\nwill begin to wither away\nimmediately after its victory\nbecause the state is unnecessary\nand cannot exist in a society in which there are no class antagonisms.\nThe question as

absolutism.\nTwo institutions most characteristic of this state machine\nare the bureaucracy and the standing army.\nIn their works,\nMarx and Engels repeatedly\nshow that the bourgeoisie\nare connected with these institutions\nby thousands of threads.\nEvery worker's experience\nillustrates this connection\nin an extremely graphic and impressive manner.\nFrom its own bitter experience,\nthe working class\nlearns to recognize this connection.\nThat is why it so easily grasps\nand so firmly learns the doctrine\nwhich shows the inevitability of this connection,\na doctrine\nwhich the petty-bourgeois democrats\neither ignorantly and flippantly deny,\nor still more flippantly admit “in general”,\nwhile forgetting to draw appropriate practical conclusions.\n\nThe bureaucracy and the standing army\nare a “parasite”\non the body of bourgeois society —\na parasite created by the internal antagonisms\nwhich rend that society,\nbut a parasite\nwhich “chokes” all its vital pores.\nThe Kautskyite opportunism\nnow prevailing in official Social-Democracy\nconsiders the view\nthat the state is a parasitic organism\nto be the peculiar and exclusive attribute of anarchism.\nIt goes without saying that this distortion of Marxism\nis of vast advantage\nto those philistines\nwho have reduced socialism\nto the unheard-of disgrace\nof justifying\nand prettifying the imperialist war\nby applying to it\nthe concept of “defence of the fatherland”;\nbut it is unquestionably a distortion, nevertheless.\n\nThe development, perfection, and strengthening of the bureaucratic and military apparatus\nproceeded during all the numerous bourgeois revolutions\nwhich Europe has witnessed since the fall of feudalism.\nIn particular,\nit is the petty bourgeois\nwho are attracted to the side of the big bourgeoisie\nand are largely subordinated to them\nthrough this apparatus,\nwhich provides the upper sections of the peasants,\nsmall artisans, tradesmen, and the like\nwith comparatively comfortable, quiet, and respectable jobs raising the holders above the people.\nConsider what happened in Russia\nduring the six months following February 27, 1917.\nThe official posts\nwhich formerly were given by preference to the Black Hundreds\nhave now become the spoils of the Cadets, Mensheviks,\nand Social-Revolutionaries.\nNobody has really thought of introducing any serious reforms.\nEvery effort has been made\nto put them off “until the Constituent Assembly meets”,\nand to steadily put off its convocation\nuntil after the war!\nBut there has been no delay,\nno waiting for the Constituent Assembly,\nin the matter of dividing the spoils\nof getting the lucrative jobs of ministers, deputy ministers, governors-general, etc., etc.!\nThe game of combinations\nthat has been played in forming the government\nhas been, in essence,\nonly an expression of this division\nand redivision of the “spoils”,\nwhich has been going on above and below,\nthroughout the country,\nin every department of central and local government.\nThe six months between February 27 and August 27, 1917,\ncan be summed up,\nobjectively summed up beyond all dispute,\nas follows:\nreforms shelved,\ndistribution of official jobs accomplished\nand “mistakes”\nin the distribution corrected by a few redistributions.\n\nBut the more the bureaucratic apparatus\nis “redistributed”\namong the various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties\n(among the Cadets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the case of Russia),\nthe more keenly aware the oppressed classes,\nand the proletariat at their head,\nbecome of their irreconcilable\nhostility\nto the whole of bourgeois society.\nHence the need for all bourgeois parties,\neven for the most democratic and “revolutionary-democratic” among them,\nto intensify repressive measures\nagainst the revolutionary proletariat,\nto strengthen the apparatus of coercion,\ni.e., the state machine.\nThis course of events\ncompels the revolution “\nto concentrate all its forces of destruction”\nagainst the state power,\nand to set itself the aim,\nnot of improving the state machine,\nbut of smashing and destroying it.\n\nIt was not logical reasoning,\nbut actual developments,\nthe actual experience of 1848-51,\nthat led to the matter being presented in this way.\nThe extent to which Marx held strictly to the solid ground of historical experience\ncan be seen from the fact that, in 1852,\nhe did not yet specifically\nraise the question\nof what was to take the place of the state machine to be destroyed.\nExperience had not yet provided material for dealing with this question,\nwhich history placed on the agenda later on, in 1871.\nIn 1852,\nall that could be established\nwith the accuracy of scientific observation\nwas that the proletarian revolution\nhad approached the task\nof “concentrating all its forces of destruction”\nagainst the state power,\nof “smashing” the state machine.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 12, "line_range": "1396-1528", "word_count": 754,

apply them to a field that is wider than the history of France\nduring the three years 1848-51?\nBefore proceeding to deal with this question,\nlet us recall a remark made by Engels\nand then examine the facts.\nIn his introduction to the third edition of The Eighteenth Brumaire,\nEngels wrote:\n<blockquote>“France is the country where, more than anywhere else,\nthe historical class struggles\nwere each time fought out to a finish,\nand where, consequently, the changing political forms\nwithin which they move and in which their results are summarized\nhave been stamped in the

bourgeoisie\nappeared here in an acute form unknown elsewhere.\n” <sup>[link to citation needed]</sup></blockquote>\nThe last remark is out of date insomuch\nas since 1871\nthere has been a lull in the revolutionary struggle\nof the French proletariat,\nalthough, long as this lull may be,\nit does not at all\npreclude the possibility\nthat in the coming proletarian revolution France\nmay show herself\nto be the classic country\nof the class struggle to a finish.\n\nLet us, however,\ncast a general glance\nover the history\nof the advanced countries\nat the turn of the century.\nWe shall see that the same process\nwent on more slowly,\nin more varied forms,\nin a much wider field:\non the one hand,\nthe development of “parliamentary power”\nboth in the republican countries\n(France, America, Switzerland),\nand in the monarchies\n(Britain, Germany to a certain extent, Italy, the Scandinavia countries, etc.);\non the other hand,\na struggle for power\namong the various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties\nwhich distributed and redistributed the “spoils” of office,\nwith the foundations of bourgeois society unchanged;\nand, lastly, the perfection and consolidation\nof the “executive power”,\nof its bureaucratic and military apparatus.\n\nThere is not the slightest doubt\nthat these features\nare common to the whole of the modern evolution of all capitalist states in general.\nIn the last three years 1848-51 France\ndisplayed,\nin a swift, sharp, concentrated form,\nthe very same processes of development\nwhich are peculiar to the whole capitalist world.\n\nImperialism\n—\nthe era of bank capital,\nthe era of gigantic capitalist monopolies,\nof the development of monopoly capitalism\ninto state-monopoly capitalism —\nhas clearly shown an unprecedented growth\nin its bureaucratic and military apparatus\nin connection with the intensification\nof repressive measures\nagainst the proletariat\nboth in the monarchical and in the freest, republican countries.\n\nWorld history\nis now undoubtedly leading,\non an incomparably larger scale\nthan in 1852,\nto the “concentration of all the forces”\nof the proletarian revolution\non the “destruction” of the state machine.\n\nWhat the proletariat will put in its place\nis suggested by the highly instructive material furnished by the Paris Commune.\n\nThe presentation of the question by Marx in 1852\nIn 1907, Mehring,\nin the magazine Neue Zeit (Vol.XXV, 2, p.164),\npublished extracts from Marx's letter to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852.\nThis letter, among other things,\ncontains the following remarkable observation:\n<blockquote>“\nAnd now as to myself,\nno credit is due to me\nfor discovering the existence of classes\nin modern society\nor the struggle between them.\nLong before me bourgeois historians\nhad described the historical development\nof this class struggle\nand bourgeois economists,\nthe economic anatomy of classes.\nWhat I did that was new was to prove:\n\n# that the existence of classes\nis only bound up with the particular,\nhistorical phases\nin the development of production\n(historische Entwicklungsphasen der Produktion),\n# that the class struggle\nnecessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat,\n# that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition\nto the abolition of all classes\nand to a classless society.\n” <sup>[link to citation needed]</sup> </blockquote>In these words,\nMarx succeeded in expressing with striking clarity,\nfirst, the chief and radical difference\nbetween his theory\nand

heaven”.\nAlthough the mass revolutionary movement\ndid not achieve its aim,\nhe regarded it as a historic experience\nof enormous importance,\nas a certain advance\nof the world proletarian revolution,\nas a practical step\nthat was more important\nthan hundreds of programmes and arguments.\nMarx endeavored to analyze this experiment,\nto draw tactical lessons from it\nand re-examine his theory\nin the light of it.\n\nThe only “correction” Marx thought it necessary\nto make to the Communist Manifesto\nhe made on the basis of the revolutionary experience\nof the Paris Commune.\n\nThe last preface to the new German edition of the Communist Manifesto,\nsigned by both its authors,\nis dated June 24, 1872.\nIn this preface the authors, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels,\nsay that the programme of the Communist Manifesto “\nhas in some details become out-of-date”,\nand the go on to say:\n    <blockquote>“...\nOne thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz.,\nthat 'the working class\ncannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery\nand wield it for its own purposes'....\n    ”</blockquote>The authors took the words that are in single quotation marks\nin this passage from Marx's book,\nThe civil war in France.\n\nThus,\nMarx and Engels\nregarded one principal and fundamental lesson\nof the Paris Commune\nas being of such enormous importance\nthat they introduced it\nas an important correction\ninto the Communist Manifesto.\n\nMost characteristically,\nit is this important correction\nthat has been distorted\nby the opportunists,\nand its meaning probably is not known to nine-tenths,\nif not ninety-nine-hundredths,\nof the readers of the Communist Manifesto.\nWe shall deal with this distortion\nmore fully farther on,\nin a chapter devoted specially to distortions.\nHere it will be sufficient\nto note that the current, vulgar “interpretation”\nof Marx's famous statement just quoted\nis that Marx here allegedly emphasizes the idea of slow development\nin contradistinction\nto the seizure of power,\nand so on.\n\nAs a matter of fact,\nthe exact opposite is the case.\nMarx's idea is that the working class\nmust break up,\nsmash the “ready-made state machinery”,\nand not confine itself merely to laying hold of it.\n\nOn April 12, 1871, i.e., just at the time of the Commune,\nMarx wrote to Kugelmann:<blockquote>“\nIf you look up the last chapter of my Eighteenth Brumaire,\nyou will find that I declare that the next attempt of the French Revolution\nwill be no longer, as before,\nto transfer the bureaucratic-military machine from one hand to another,\nbut to smash it [Marx's italics — the original is zerbrechen],\nand this is the precondition\nfor every real people's revolution on the Continent.\nAnd this is what our heroic Party comrades in Paris\nare attempting.\n” </blockquote>\n(The letters of Marx to Kugelmann have appeared in Russian in no less than two editions,\none of which I edited and supplied with a preface.)\n\nThe words,\n“to smash the bureaucratic-military machine”,\nbriefly express the principal lesson of Marxism\nregarding the tasks of the proletariat\nduring a revolution\nin relation to the state.\nAnd this is the lesson that has been not only completely ignored,\nbut positively distorted\nby the prevailing, Kautskyite, “interpretation” of Marxism!\n\nAs for Marx's reference to The Eighteenth Brumaire,\nwe have quoted the relevant passage in full above.\n\nIt is interesting to note,\nin particular,\ntwo points in the above-quoted argument of Marx.\nFirst, he restricts his conclusion to the Continent.\nThis was understandable in 1871,\nwhen Britain was still the model\nof a purely capitalist country,\nbut without a militarist clique\nand, to a considerable degree,\nwithout a bureaucracy.\nMarx therefore excluded Britain,\nwhere a revolution,\neven a people's revolution,\nthen seemed possible,\nand indeed was possible,\nwithout the precondition\nof destroying “ready-made state machinery”.\n\nToday, in 1917,\nat the time of the first great imperialist war,\nthis restriction made by Marx\nis no longer valid.\nBoth Britain and America,\nthe biggest and the last representatives —\nin the whole world —\nof Anglo-Saxon “liberty”,\nin the sense that they had no militarist cliques and bureaucracy,\nhave completely sunk into the all-European filthy,\nbloody morass\nof bureaucratic-military institutions\nwhich subordinate everything to themselves,\nand suppress everything.\nToday, in Britain and America, too,\n“the precondition for every real people's revolution”\nis the smashing,\nthe destruction of the “ready-made state machinery”\n(made and brought up to the “European”,\ngeneral imperialist,\nperfection in those countries in the years 1914-17).", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 15, "line_range": "1805-1945", "word_count": 748,

and political demands\nto any noticeable degree.\nBy contrast,\nalthough the Russian bourgeois revolution of 1905-07\ndisplayed no such “brilliant” successes\nas at time fell to the Portuguese and

destroyed.\n\nIn Europe,\nin 1871,\nthe proletariat did not constitute the majority of the people in any country on the Continent.\nA “people's” revolution,\none actually sweeping the majority into

France.\nLet us quote the most important passages of this work.\n<blockquote>\nOriginating from the Middle Ages,\nthere developed in the 19th century\n“\nthe centralized state power,\nwith its ubiquitous organs\nof standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and judicature.\n”\nWith the development of class antagonisms\nbetween capital and labor,\n“\nstate power assumed more and more the character of a public force\norganized for the suppression of the working class,\nof a machine of class rule.\nAfter every revolution,\nwhich marks an advance in the class struggle,\nthe purely coercive character of the state power\nstands out in bolder and bolder relief.\n”\nAfter the revolution of 1848-49,\nstate power became “the national war instruments of capital against labor”.\nThe Second Empire consolidated this.\n\n“The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune.\n”\nIt was the “specific form” of “a republic that was not only to remove the monarchical form of class rule,\nbut class rule itself.\n”</blockquote>\nWhat was this “specific” form of the proletarian, socialist republic?\nWhat was the state it began to create?\n    <blockquote>“\nThe first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the suppression of the standing army,\nand the substitution for it of the armed people.\n    ”</blockquote>This demand now figures in the programme of every party calling itself socialist.\nThe real worth of their programme, however,\nis best shown by the behavior of our Social-Revolutionists\nand mensheviks,\nwho, right after the revolution of February 27,\nrefused to carry out this demand!\n    <blockquote>“The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors,\nchosen by universal suffrage\nin the various wards of the town,\nresponsible and revocable at any time.\nThe majority of its members\nwere naturally working men,\nor acknowledged representatives of the working class....\nThe police,\nwhich until then had been the instrument of the Government,\nwas at once stripped of its political attributes,\nand turned into the responsible,\nand at all times revocable,\nagent of the Commune.\nSo were the officials of all other branches of the administration.\nFrom the members of the Commune downwards,\nthe public service had to be done at workmen's wages.\nThe privileges and the representation allowances\nof the high dignitaries of state disappeared\nalong with the high dignitaries themselves....\nHaving once got rid of the standing army and the police,\nthe instruments of physical force of the old government,\nthe Commune proceeded at once\nto break the instrument of spiritual suppression,\nthe power of the priests....\nThe judicial functionaries\nlost that sham independence...\nthey were thenceforward\nto be elective, responsible, and revocable.\n”</blockquote>The Commune, therefore,\nappears to have replaced the smashed state machine “only” by fuller democracy:\nabolition of the standing army;\nall officials to be elected and subject to recall.\nBut as a matter of fact\nthis “only”\nsignifies a gigantic replacement\nof certain institutions\nby other institutions of a fundamentally different type.\nThis is exactly a case of “quantity being transformed into quality”:\ndemocracy, introduced as fully and consistently as is at all conceivable,\nis transformed from bourgeois into proletarian democracy;\nfrom the state (= a special force for the suppression of a particular class)\ninto something\nwhich is no longer the state proper.\n\nIt is still necessary\nto suppress the bourgeoisie\nand crush their resistance.\nThis was particularly necessary for the Commune;\nand one of the reasons for its defeat\nwas that it did not do this\nwith sufficient determination.\nThe organ of suppression, however,\nis here the majority of the population,\nand not a minority,\nas was always the case under slavery, serfdom,\nand wage slavery.\nAnd since the majority of people itself\nsuppresses its oppressors,\na 'special force”\nfor suppression is no longer necessary!\nIn this sense,\nthe state begins to wither away.\nInstead of the special institutions\nof a privileged minority\n(privileged officialdom, the chiefs of the standing army),\nthe majority itself can directly fulfil all these functions,\nand the more the functions of state power\nare performed by the people as a whole,\nthe less need there is for the existence of this power.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 17, "line_range":

accounting,\nbecoming more and more simple,\nwill be performed by each in turn,\nwill then become a habit\nand will finally die out\nas the special functions\nof a special section of the population.\n\nA witty German Social-Democrat of the seventies of the last century\ncalled the postal service\nan example of the socialist economic system.\nThis is very true.\nAt the present the postal service is a business organized on the lines of state-capitalist monopoly.\nImperialism is gradually transforming all trusts\ninto organizations of a similar type,\nin which, standing over the “common” people,\nwho are overworked and starved,\none has the same bourgeois bureaucracy.\nBut the mechanism of social management\nis here already to hand.\nOnce we have overthrown the capitalists,\ncrushed the resistance of these exploiters\nwith the iron hand of the armed workers,\nand smashed the bureaucratic machinery\nof the modern state,\nwe shall have a splendidly-equipped mechanism,\nfreed from the “parasite”,\na mechanism which can very well be set going by the united workers themselves,\nwho will hire technicians, foremen and accountants,\nand pay them all,\nas indeed all “state” officials in general,\nworkmen's wages.\nHere is a concrete,\npractical task\nwhich can immediately be fulfilled\nin relation to all trusts,\na task whose fulfilment will rid the working people of exploitation,\na task which takes account of what the Commune had already begun to practice\n(particularly in building up the state).\n\nTo organize the whole economy\non the lines of the postal service\nso that the technicians, foremen and accountants,\nas well as all officials,\nshall receive salaries no higher than “a workman's wage”,\nall under the control and leadership\nof the armed proletariat —\nthat is our immediate aim.\nThis is what will bring about the abolition of parliamentarism\nand the preservation of representative institutions.\nThis is what will rid the laboring classes\nof the bourgeoisie's prostitution of these institutions.\n\nOrganization of National Unity <blockquote>“\nIn a brief sketch of national organization\nwhich the Commune had no time to

Commune,\nand dealt several times with the tasks of the revolution\nin relation to the state.\nIt is interesting\nto note that the treatment of this specific subject clearly revealed,\non the one hand,\npoints of similarity\nbetween the proletarian state and the present state —\npoints that warrant speaking of the state in both cases —\nand, on the other hand,\npoints of difference between them,\nor the transition to the destruction of the state.\n    <blockquote>“How is the housing question to be settled then?\nIn present-day society,\nit is settled just as any other social question:\nby the gradual economic levelling of demand and supply,\na settlement which reproduces the question itself again and again and therefore is no settlement.\nHow a social revolution\nwould settle this question\nnot only depends on the circumstances in each particular case,\nbut is also connected with much more far-reaching questions,\none of the most fundamental of which is the abolition of the antithesis\nbetween town and country.\nAs it is not our task\nto create utopian systems\nfor the organization of the future society,\nit would be more than idle\nto go into the question here.\nBut one thing is certain:\nthere is already a sufficient quantity of houses in the big cities\nto remedy immediately all real 'housing shortage',\nprovided they are used judiciously.\nThis can naturally only occur\nthrough the expropriation of the present owners\nand by quartering in their houses homeless workers or workers overcrowded in their present homes.\nAs soon as the proletariat has won political power,\nsuch a measure prompted by concern for the common good\nwill be just as easy to carry out\nas are other expropriations and billetings by the present-day state.\n”</blockquote>The change in the form of state power\nis not examined here,\nbut only the content of its activity.\nExpropriations and billetings take place by order even of the present state.\nFrom the formal point of view,\nthe proletarian state will also “order” the occupation of dwellings\nand expropriation of houses.\nBut it is clear\nthat the old executive apparatus,\nthe bureaucracy,\nwhich is connected with the bourgeoisie,\nwould simply be unfit to carry out the orders of the proletarian state.\n    <blockquote>“...\nIt must be pointed out\nthat the 'actual seizure'\nof all the instruments of labor,\nthe taking possession of industry as a whole by the working people,\nis the exact opposite of the Proudhonist 'redemption'.\nIn the latter case the individual worker becomes the owner of the dwelling,\nthe peasant farm,\nthe instruments of labor;\nin the former case,\nthe 'working people'\nremain the collective owners of the houses,\nfactories and instruments of labor,\nand will hardly permit their use,\nat least during a transitional period,\nby individuals or associations\nwithout compensation for the cost.\nIn the same way,\nthe abolition of property in land\nis not the abolition of ground rent\nbut its transfer,\nif in a modified form, to society.\nThe actual seizure of all the instruments of labor\nby the working people,\ntherefore,\ndoes not at all\npreclude the retention of rent relations.\n”</blockquote>\nWe shall examine the question\ntouched upon in this passage,\nnamely, the economic basis\nfor the withering away of the state,\nin the next chapter.\nEngels expresses himself most cautiously.\nsaying that the proletarian state\nwould “hardly”\npermit the use of houses without payment,\n“at least during a transitional period”.\nThe letting of houses owed by the whole people\nto individual families\npresupposes the collection of rent,\na certain amount of control,\nand the employment of some standard in allotting the housing.\nAll this calls for a certain form of state,\nbut it does not at all\ncall for a special military bureaucratic apparatus,\nwith officials occupying especially

Italian socialist annual,\nand it was not until 1913\nthat these articles appeared in German in Neue Zeit.\n<blockquote>“\nIf the political struggle of the working class assumes revolutionary form,\n”\nwrote Marx,\nridiculing the anarchists\nfor their repudiation of politics,\n“\nand if the workers set up their revolutionary dictatorship in place of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie,\nthey commit the terrible crime of violating principles,\nfor in order to satisfy their wretched,\nvulgar everyday needs\nand to crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie,\nthey give the state a revolutionary and transient form,\ninstead of laying down their arms and abolishing the state.\n”</blockquote>\nIt was solely against this kind of “abolition”\nof the state\nthat Marx fought in refuting the anarchists!\nHe did not at all\noppose the view that the state would disappear\nwhen classes disappeared,\nor that it would be abolished\nwhen classes were abolished.\nWhat he did oppose\nwas the proposition\nthat the workers should renounce the use of arms,\norganized violence,\nthat is, the state,\nwhich is to serve to “crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie”.\n\nTo prevent the true meaning\nof his struggle against anarchism\nfrom being distorted,\nMarx expressly emphasized the “revolutionary and transient form”\nof the state\nwhich the proletariat needs.\nThe proletariat needs the state only temporarily.\nWe do not after all differ\nwith the anarchists\non the question of the abolition of the state as the aim.\nWe maintain that,\nto achieve this aim,\nwe must temporarily make use of the instruments, resources, and methods of state power\nagainst the exploiters,\njust as the temporary dictatorship of the oppressed class\nis necessary for the abolition of classes.\nMarx chooses the sharpest and clearest way of stating his case against the anarchists:\nAfter overthrowing the yoke of the capitalists,\nshould the workers “lay down their arms”,\nor use them against the capitalists\nin order to crush their resistance?\nBut what is the systematic use of arms by ne class\nagainst another\nif not a “transient form” of state?\n\nLet every Social-Democrat

application\nvaries with the various phases of social development,\nthat it is absurd\nto take them as absolutes,\nand adding that the sphere of application of machinery\nand large-scale production\nis steadily expanding,\nEngels passes from the general discussion of authority\nto the question of the state.\n    <blockquote>“Had the autonomists,” he wrote,\n“contented themselves with saying\nthat the social organization of the future\nwould allow authority\nonly within the bounds\nwhich the conditions of production\nmake inevitable,\none could have come to terms with them.\nBut they are blind to all facts\nthat make authority necessary\nand they passionately fight the word.\n\n“\nWhy do the anti-authoritarians\nnot confine themselves\nto crying out against political authority, the state?\nAll socialists are agreed that the state,\nand with it political authority,\nwill disappear\nas a result of the coming social revolution,\nthat is,\nthat public functions\nwill lose their political character\nand become mere administrative functions\nof watching over social interests.\nBut the anti-authoritarians\ndemand that the political state be abolished at one stroke,\neven before the social relations\nthat gave both to it have been destroyed.\nThey demand that the first act of the social revolution\nshall be the abolition of authority.\n\n“\nHave these gentlemen ever seen a revolution?\nA revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;\nit is an act whereby one part of the population\nimposes its will\nupon the other part\nby means of rifles, bayonets and cannon,\nall of which are highly authoritarian means.\nAnd the victorious party\nmust maintain its rule\nby means of the terror\nwhich its arms inspire in the reactionaries.\nWould the Paris Commune have lasted more than a day if it had not used the authority\nof the armed people\nagainst the bourgeoisie?\nCannot we, on the contrary,\nblame it for having made too little use of that authority?\nTherefore,\none of two things:\neither that anti-authoritarians down't know what they are talking about,\nin which case they are creating nothing but confusion.\nOr they do know,\nand in that case they are betraying the cause of the proletariat.\nIn either case they serve only reaction.\n”</blockquote>\nThis argument\ntouches upon questions\nwhich should be examined\nin connection with the relationship\nbetween politics and economics\nduring the withering away of the state\n(the next chapter is devoted to this).\nThese questions are:\nthe transformation of public functions\nfrom political into simple functions of administration,\nand the “political state”.\nThis last term,\none particularly liable to misunderstanding,\nindicates the process of the withering away of the state:\nat a certain stage of this process,\nthe state which is withering away\nmay be called a non-political state.\n\nAgainst,\nthe most remarkable thing in this argument of Engels'\nis the way he states his case against the anarchists.\nSocial-Democrats,\nclaiming to be disciples of Engels,\nhave argued on this subject\nagainst the anarchists millions of times since 1873,\nbut they have not argued as Marxists could and should.\nThe anarchist idea of abolition of the state\nis muddled and non-revolutionary —\nthat is how Engels put it.\nIt is precisely the revolution\nin its rise and development,\nwith its specific tasks\nin relation to violence, authority, power, the state,\nthat the anarchists refuse to see.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir

{"chunk_id": "Main/Library_Vladimir_Lenin_The_state_and_revolution#28", "text": "The usual criticism of anarchism\nby present-day Social-Democrats\nhas boiled down\nto the purest philistine banality:\n“We recognize the state,\nwhereas the anarchists do not!”\nNaturally,\nsuch banality\ncannot but repel workers\nwho are at all capable of thinking and revolutionary-minded.\nWhat Engels says is different.\nHe stresses that all socialists recognize that the state will disappear\nas a result of the socialist revolution.\nHe then deals specifically with the question of the revolution\n- the very question\nwhich, as a rule,\nthe Social-Democrats\nevade out of opportunism,\nleaving it, so to speak,\nexclusively for the anarchists “to work out”.\nAnd when dealing with this question,\nEngels takes the bull by the horns; he asks:\nshould not the Commune\nhave made more use of the revolutionary power of the state,\nthat is,\nof the proletariat armed and organized as the ruling class?\n\nPrevailing official Social-Democracy\nusually dismissed the question\nof the concrete tasks\nof the proletariat in the revolution\neither with a philistine sneer,\nor, at best, with the sophistic evasion: “The future will show”.\nAnd the anarchists were justified in saying about such Social-Democrats\nthat they were failing\nin their task\nof giving the workers a revolutionary education.\nEngels draws upon the experience\nof the last proletarian revolution\nprecisely for the purpose of making a most concrete study\nof what should be done by the proletariat,\nand in what manner,\nin relation to both the banks and the state.\n\nLetter to Bebel One of the most, if not the most,\nremarkable observation on the state in the works of Marx and Engels\nis contained in the following passage in Engels' letter to Bebel dated March 18-28, 1875.\nThis letter, we may observe in parenthesis,\nwas, as far as we know,\nfirst published by Bebel\nin the second volume of his memoirs (Aus meinem Leben),\nwhich appeared in 1911, i.e., 36 years after the letter had been written and sent.\n\nEngels wrote to Bebel criticizing the same draft of the Gotha Programme\nwhich Marx criticized in his famous letter to Bracke.\nReferring specially to the question of the state,\nEngels said:\n<blockquote>“\nThe free people's state\nhas been transferred into the free state.\nTaken in its grammatical sense,\na free state is one where the state is free in relation to its citizens,\nhence a state with a despotic government.\nThe whole talk about the state should be dropped,\nespecially since the Commune,\nwhich was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word.\nThe 'people's state'\nhas been thrown in our faces\nby the anarchists\nto the point of disgust,\nalthough already Marx's book against Proudhon\nand later the Communist Manifesto\nsay plainly that with the introduction of the socialist order of society\nthe state dissolves of itself [sich auflost]\nand disappears.\nAs the state is only a transitional institution\nwhich is used in the struggle, in the revolution,\nto hold down one's adversaries by force,\nit is sheer nonsense to talk of a 'free people's state';\nso long as the proletariat still needs the state,\nit does not need it in the interests of freedom\nbut in order to hold down its adversaries,\nand as soon as it becomes possible\nto speak of freedom the state\nas such ceases to exist.\nWe would therefore propose replacing the state everywhere\nby Gemeinwesen,\na good old German word\nwhich can very well take the place of the French word commune.\n”</blockquote>\nIt should be borne in mind that this letter refers to the party programme\nwhich Marx criticized in a letter dated only a few weeks later\nthan the above (Marx's letter is dated May 5, 1875),\nand that at the time Engels was living with Marx in London.\nConsequently, when he says “we” in the last sentence,\nEngels undoubtedly, in his own as well as in Marx's name,\nsuggests to the leader of the German workers' party\nthat the word “state”\nbe struck out of the programme\nand replaced by the word “community”.\n\nWhat a howl about “anarchism”\nwould be raised\nby the leading lights of present-day “Marxism”,\nwhich has been falsified\nfor the convenience of the opportunists,\nif such an amendment of the programme\nwere suggested to them!\n\nLet them howl.\nThis will earn them the praises of the bourgeoisie.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null,

democratic republic.\nThis is even the specific form\nfor the dictatorship of the proletariat,\nas the Great French Revolution has already shown...\n”</blockquote>Engels realized here in a particularly striking form the fundamental idea\nwhich runs through all of Marx's works,\nnamely,\nthat the democratic republic\nis the nearest approach to the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nFor such a republic,\nwithout in the least abolishing the rule of capital,\nand, therefore, the oppression of the masses\nnd the class struggle,\ninevitably leads to such an extension, development, unfolding,\nand intensification of this struggle\nthat,\nas soon as it becomes possible\nto meet the fundamental interests\nof the oppressed masses,\nthis possibility is realized inevitably and solely through the dictatorship of the proletariat,\nthrough the leadership of those masses by the proletariat.\nThese, too,\nare “forgotten words” of marxism\nfor the whole of the Second International,\nand the fact that they have been forgotten\nwas demonstrated\nwith particular vividness\nby the history of the Menshevik Party\nduring the first six months of the Russian revolution of 1917.\n\nOn the subject of a federal republic,\nin connection with the national composition of the population,\nEngels wrote:\n<blockquote>“\nWhat should take the place of the present-day Germany [\nwith its reactionary monarchical Constitution\nand its equally reactionary division\ninto petty states,\na division which perpetuates all the specific features of “Prussianism”\ninstead of dissolving them in Germany as a whole]?\nIn my view,\nthe proletariat can only use the form of the one and indivisible republic.\nIn the gigantic territory of the United States,\na federal republic is still, on the whole, a necessity,\nalthough in the Eastern states\nit is already becoming a hindrance.\nIt would be a step forward in Britain\nwhere the two islands are peopled by four nations\nand in spite of a single Parliament\nthree different systems of legislation already exist side by side.\nIn little Switzerland,\nit has long been a hindrance,\ntolerable only because Switzerland is content to be a purely passive member of the European state system.\nFor Germany,\nfederalization on the Swiss model\nwould be an enormous step backward.\nTwo points distinguish a union state\nfrom a completely unified state:\nfirst,\nthat each member state,\neach canton,\nhas its own civil and criminal legislative and judicial system,\nand, second, that alongside a popular chamber\nthere is also a federal chamber in which each canton,\nwhether large or small,\nvotes as such.”\nIn Germany,\nthe union state is the transition\nto the completely unified state,\nand the “revolution from above”\nof 1866 and 1870\nmust not be reversed\nbut supplemented by a “movement from below”.\n</blockquote>Far from being indifferent to the forms of state, Engels, on the contrary,\ntried to analyze the transitional forms\nwith the utmost thoroughness\nin order to establish,\nin accordance with the concrete historical peculiarities\nof each particular case,\nfrom what and to what the given transitional form is passing.\n\nApproaching the matter\nfrom the standpoint of the proletariat\nand the proletarian revolution,\nEngels, like Marx,\nupheld democratic centralism,\nthe republic — one and indivisible.\nHe regarded the federal republic\neither as an exception\nand a hindrance to development,\nor as a transition from a monarchy to a centralized republic,\nas a “step forward”\nunder certain special conditions.\nAnd among these special conditions,\nhe puts the national question to the fore.\n\nAlthough mercilessly criticizing the reactionary nature of small states,\nand the screening of this\nby the national question\nin certain concrete cases,\nEngels, like Marx,\nnever betrayed the slightest desire\nto brush aside the national question —\na desire of which the Dutch and Polish Marxists,\nwho proceed from their perfectly justified opposition\nto the narrow philistine nationalism\nof “their” little states,\nare often guilty.\n\nEven in regard to britain,\nwhere geographical conditions,\na common language and the history of many centuries\nwould seem to have “put an end”\nto the national question\nin the various small divisions of the country —\neven in regard to to that country,\nEngels reckoned with the plain fact that the national question\nwas not yet a thing of the past,\nand recognized in consequence\nthat the establishment of a federal republic\nwould be a “step forward”.\nOf course,\nthere is not the slightest hint here of Engels\nabandoning the criticism\nof the shortcomings\nof a federal republic\nor renouncing the most determined advocacy of,\nand struggle for,\na unified and centralized democratic republic.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 32,

France\n(this preface is dated March 18, 1891,\nand was originally published in Neue Zeit),\nEngels,\nin addition to some interesting incidental remarks\non questions concerning the attitude towards the state,\ngave a remarkably vivid summary\nof the lessons of the Commune.\nThis summary,\nmade more profound\nby the entire experience\nof the 20 years that separated the author from the Commune,\nand directed expressly\nagainst the “superstitious belief in the state”\nso widespread in Germany,\nmay justly be called the last word of Marxism\non the question under consideration.\n<blockquote>In France,\nEngels observed,\nthe workers emerged with arms from every revolution:\n“\ntherefore the disarming of the workers\nwas the first commandment for the bourgeois,\nwho were at the helm of the state.\nHence,\nafter every revolution won by the workers,\na new struggle,\nending with the defeat of the workers.\n”</blockquote>\nThis summary of the experience of bourgeois revolutions\nis as concise as it is expressive.\nThe essence of the matter — among other things,\non the question of the state (has the oppressed class arms?) —\nis here remarkably well-grasped.\nIt is precisely this essence\nthat is most often evaded\nby both professors\ninfluenced by bourgeois ideology,\nand by petty-bourgeois democrats.\nIn the Russian revolution of 1917,\nthe honor (Cavaignac honor)\nof blabbing this secret of bourgeois revolutions\nfell to the Menshevik,\nwould-be Marxist, Tsereteli.\nIn his “historic” speech of June 11, Tsereteli blurted out that the bourgeoisie\nwere determined to disarm the Petrograd workers —\npresenting, of course,\nthis decision as his own,\nand as a necessity for the “state” in general!\n\nTsereteli's historical speech of June 11 will, of course,\nserve every historian of the revolution of 1917\nas a graphic illustration\nof how the Social-Revolutionary and Menshevik bloc,\nled by Mr. Tsereteli,\ndeserted to the bourgeoisie\nagainst the revolutionary proletariat.\n\nAnother incidental remark of Engels',\nalso connected with the question of the state,\ndeals with religion.\nIt is well-known\nthat the German Social-Democrats,\nas they degenerated\nand became increasingly opportunist,\nslipped more and more frequently\ninto the philistine misinterpretation\nof the celebrated formula:\n“Religion is to be declared a private matter.\n”\nThat is,\nthe formula was twisted to mean that religion was a private matter\neven for the party of the revolutionary proletariat!!\nIt was against this complete betrayal\nof the revolutionary programme\nof the proletariat\nthat Engels vigorously protested.\nIn 1891\nhe saw only the very feeble beginnings\nof opportunism in his party,\nand, therefore, he expressed himself with extreme caution:\n<blockquote>“\nAs almost only workers,\nor recognized representatives of the workers,\nsat in the Commune,\nits decisions bore a decidedly proletarian character.\nEither they decreed reforms\nwhich the republican bourgeoisie\nhad failed to pass solely out of cowardice,\nbut which provided a necessary basis\nfor the free activity of the working class —\nsuch as the realization of the principle that in relation to the state religion\nis a purely private matter —\nor the Commune\npromulgated decrees\nwhich were in the direct interest of the working class\nand in part cut deeply into the old order of society.\n”</blockquote>Engels deliberately emphasized the words “in relation to the state”\nas a straight thrust at at German opportunism,\nwhich had declared religion to be a private matter\nin relation to the party,\nthus degrading the party of the revolutionary proletariat\nto the level of the most vulgar “free-thinking” philistinism,\nwhich is prepared to allow a non-denominational status,\nbut which renounces the party struggle\nagainst the opium of religion\nwhich stupifies the people.\n\nThe future historian\nof the German Social-Democrats,\nin tracing the roots of their shameful bankruptcy in 1914,\nwill find a fair amount of interesting material on this question,\nbeginning with the evasive declarations\nin the articles of the party's ideological leader, Kautsky,\nwhich throw the door wide open to opportunism,\nand ending with the attitude of the party\ntowards the “Los-von-Kirche-Bewegung”\n(the “Leave-the-Church” movement)\nin 1913.\n\nBut let us see how, 20 years after the Commune,\nEngels summed up its lessons\nfor the fighting proletariat.\n\nHere are the lessons to which Engels attached prime importance:\n<blockquote>“...\nIt was precisely the oppressing power\nof the former centralized government, army, political parties, bureaucracy,\nwhich Napoleon had created in 1798\nand which every new government had since then taken over\nas a welcome instrument\nand used against its opponents —\nit was this power\nwhich was to fall everywhere,\njust as it had fallen in Paris.",

the moment of the future “withering away”,\nthe more so since it will obviously be a lengthy process.\nThe apparent difference between Marx and Engels is due to the fact that they dealt with different

small degree by Lassalle).\nMarx only touched upon this question in passing,\nbeing interested in another subject,\nnamely, the development of communist society.\n\nThe whole theory of Marx\nis the application of the theory of development —\nin its most consistent, complete, considered and pithy form —\nto modern capitalism.\nNaturally, Marx was faced with the problem\nof applying this theory\nboth to the forthcoming collapse of capitalism\nand to the future development of future communism.\n\nOn the basis of what facts,\nthen,\ncan the question of the future development of future communism\nbe dealt with?\n\nOn the basis of the fact that it has its origin in capitalism,\nthat it develops historically from capitalism,\nthat it is the result of the action of a social force\nto which capitalism gave birth.\nThere is no trace of an attempt on Marx's part\nto make up a utopia,\nto indulge in idle guess-work\nabout what cannot be known.\nMarx treated the question of communism\nin the same way as a naturalist\nwould treat the question of the development of, say, a new biological variety,\nonce he knew that it had originated in such and such a way and was changing in such and such a definite direction.\n\nTo begin with,\nMarx brushed aside the confusion\nthe Gotha Programme\nbrought into the question of the relationship between state and society.\nHe wrote:\n<blockquote>“'Present-day society' is capitalist society,\nwhich exists in all civilized countries,\nbeing more or less free\nfrom medieval admixture,\nmore or less modified\nby the particular historical development of each country,\nmore or less developed.\nOn the other hand,\nthe 'present-day state' changes with a country's frontier.\nIt is different in the Prusso-German Empire\nfrom what it is in Switzerland,\nand different in England\nfrom what it is in the United States.\n'The present-day state' is, therefore, a fiction.\n\n“\nNevertheless,\nthe different states of the different civilized countries,\nin spite of their motley diversity of form,\nall have this in common,\nthat they are based on modern bourgeois society,\nonly one more or less capitalistically developed.\nThe

Lassalle's hazy, obscure, general phrase (“the full product of his labor to the worker”),\nMarx makes a sober estimate\nof exactly how socialist society will have to manage its affairs.\nMarx proceeds to make a concrete analysis\nof the conditions of life of a society in which there will be no capitalism,\nand says:\n<blockquote>“\nWhat we have to deal with here [in analyzing the programme of the

whole of society.\nEvery member of society, performing a certain part of the socially-necessary work,\nreceives a certificate from society\nto the effect that he has done a certain amount of work.\nAnd with this certificate he receives from the public store of consumer goods\na corresponding quantity of products.\nAfter a deduction is made of the amount of labor\nwhich goes to the public fund,\nevery worker, therefore, receives from society\nas much as he has given to it.\n\n“Equality”\napparently reigns supreme.\n\nBut when Lassalle, having in view such a social order\n(usually called socialism, but termed by Marx the first phase of communism),\nsays that this is “equitable distribution”,\nthat this is “the equal right of all to an equal product of labor”,\nLassalle is mistaken and Marx exposes the mistake.\n\n“Hence, the equal right,” says Marx,\nin this case still certainly conforms to “bourgeois law”,\nwhich,like all law, implies inequality.\nAll law is an application of an equal measure\nto different people\nwho in fact are not alike,\nare not equal to one another.\nThat is why the “equal right”\nis violation of equality\nand an injustice.\nIn fact,\neveryone, having performed as much social labor as another,\nreceives an equal share\nof the social product\n(after the above-mentioned deductions).\n\nBut people are not alike:\none is strong, another is weak;\none is married, another is not;\none has more children, another has less, and so on.\nAnd the conclusion Marx draws is:\n    <blockquote>“...\nWith an equal performance of labor,\nand hence an equal share\nin the social consumption fund,\none will in fact receive more than another,\none will be richer than another, and so on.\nTo avoid all these defects,\nthe right instead of being equal\nwould have to be unequal.\n”</blockquote>\nThe first phase of communism,\ntherefore, cannot yet provide justice and equality;\ndifferences, and unjust differences,\nin wealth will still persist,\nbut the exploitation of man by man\nwill have become impossible\nbecause it will be impossible\nto seize the means of production —\nthe factories, machines, land, etc. —\nand make them private property.\nIn smashing Lassalle's petty-bourgeois,\nvague phrases about “equality”\nand “justice” in general,\nMarx shows the course of development of communist society,\nwhich is compelled to abolish at first only the “injustice”\nof the means of production seized by individuals,\nand which is unable at once\nto eliminate the other injustice,\nwhich consists in the distribution of consumer goods “according to the amount of labor performed” (and not according to needs).\n\nThe vulgar economists,\nincluding the bourgeois professors\nand “our” Tugan,\nconstantly reproach the socialists\nwith forgetting the inequality of people\nand with “dreaming”\nof eliminating this inequality.\nSuch a reproach,\nas we see,\nonly proves the extreme ignorance\nof the bourgeois ideologists.\n\nMarx not only most scrupulously\ntakes account of the inevitable inequality of men,\nbut he also takes into account the fact\nthat the mere conversion of the means of production\ninto the common property of the whole society\n(commonly called “socialism”)\ndoes not remove the defects of distribution\nand the inequality of “bourgeois laws”\nwhich continues to prevail so long\nas products are divided “according to the amount of labor performed”.\nContinuing, Marx says:\n<blockquote>“But these defects are inevitable\nin the first phase of communist society\nas it is when it has just emerged,\nafter prolonged birth pangs,\nfrom capitalist society.\nLaw can never be higher\nthan the economic structure of society\nand its cultural development\nconditioned thereby.\n”</blockquote>And so,\nin the first phase of communist society\n(usually called socialism) “bourgeois law”\nis not abolished in its entirety,\nbut only in part,\nonly in proportion to the economic revolution\nso far attained,\ni.e., only in respect of the means of production.\n“Bourgeois law” recognizes them\nas the private property of individuals.\nSocialism converts them into common property.\nTo that extent —\nand to that extent alone — “bourgeois law” disappears.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and

{"chunk_id": "Main/Library_Vladimir_Lenin_The_state_and_revolution#47", "text": "To characterize this lamentable process,\nif only briefly,\nwe shall take the most prominent theoreticians of Marxism:\nPlekhanov and Kautsky.\n\nPlekhanov's controversy\nwith the anarchists Plekhanov\nwrote a special pamphlet\non the relation of anarchism to socialism,\nentitled Anarchism and Socialism,\nwhich was published in german in 1894.\n\nIn treating this subject,\nPlekhanov contrived completely\nto evade the most urgent, burning,\nand most politically essential issue\nin the struggle against anarchism,\nnamely, the relation of the revolution to the state,\nand the question of the state in general!\nHis pamphlet falls into two distinct parts:\none of them is historical and literary,\nand contains valuable material\non the history of the ideas of Stirner, Proudhon, and others;\nthe other is philistine,\nand contains a clumsy dissertation\non the theme\nthat an anarchist cannot be distinguished from a bandit.\n\nIt is a most amusing combination of subjects\nand most characteristic of Plekhanov’s whole activity\non the eve of the revolution\nand during the revolutionary period in Russia.\nIn fact,\nin the years 1905 to 1917,\nPlekhanov revealed himself as a semi-doctrinaire\nand semi-philistine\nwho, in politics, trailed in the wake of the bourgeoisie.\n\nWe have now seen how,\nin their controversy with the anarchists,\nMarx and Engels with the utmost thoroughness\nexplained their views\non the relation of revolution to the state.\nIn 1891,\nin his foreword to Marx’s Critique of the Gotha Programme,\nEngels wrote that “we”—that is, Engels and Marx—\n“\nwere at that time, hardly two years after the Hague Congress of the [First] International,\nengaged in the most violent struggle against Bakunin and his anarchists.\n”\n\nThe anarchists\nhad tried to claim the Paris Commune\nas their “own”,\nso to say,\nas a collaboration of their doctrine;\nand they completely misunderstood its lessons\nand Marx’s analysis of these lessons.\nAnarchism has given nothing even approximating true answers\nto the concrete political questions:\nMust the old state machine be smashed?\nAnd what should be put in its place?\n\nBut to speak of “anarchism and socialism”\nwhile completely evading the question of the state,\nand disregarding the whole development of Marxism\nbefore and after the Commune,\nmeant inevitably slipping into opportunism.\nFor what opportunism needs most of all\nis that the two questions just mentioned\nshould not be raised at all.\nThat in itself\nis a victory for opportunism.\n\nKautsky's controversy\nwith the opportunists\nUndoubtedly,\nan immeasurably larger number of Kautsky’s works\nhave been translated into Russian\nthan into any other language.\nIt is not without reason\nthat some German Social-Democrats\nsay in jest that Kautsky is read more in Russia\nthan in Germany\n(let us say, in parenthesis,\nthat this jest has a far deeper historical meaning\nthan those who first made it suspect.\nThe Russian workers,\nby making in 1905\nan unusually great and unprecedented demand\nfor the best works\nof the best Social- Democratic literature\nand editions of these works\nin quantities unheard of in other countries,\nrapidly transplanted,\nso to speak,\nthe enormous experience\nof a neighboring,\nmore advanced country\nto the young soil of our proletarian movement).\n\nBesides his popularization of Marxism,\nKautsky is particularly known in our country\nfor his controversy\nwith the opportunists,\nwith Bernstein at their head.\nOne fact, however, is almost unknown,\none which cannot be ignored if we set out to investigate\nhow Kautsky drifted into the morass\nof unbelievably disgraceful confusion\nand defence\nof social-chauvinism\nduring the supreme crisis of 1914-15.\nThis fact is as follows:\nshortly before he came out against the most prominent representatives of opportunism in France\n(Millerand and Jaures)\nand in Germany (Bernstein),\nKautsky betrayed very considerable vacillation.\nThe Marxist Zarya,\nwhich was published in Stuttgart in 1901-02,\nand advocated revolutionary proletarian views,\nwas forced to enter into controversy with Kautsky and describe as “elastic”\nthe half-hearted, evasive resolution,\nconciliatory towards the opportunists,\nthat he proposed at the International Socialist Congress in Paris in 1900.\nKautsky’s letters published in Germany\nreveal no less hesitancy on his part\nbefore he took the field against Bernstein.\n\nOf immeasurably greater significance, however,\nis the fact that,\nin his very controversy\nwith the opportunists,\nin his formulation of the question and his manner of treating it,\nwe can now see,\nas we study the history of Kautsky’s latest betrayal of Marxism,\nhis systematic deviation\ntowards opportunism\nprecisely on the question of the state.\n\nLet us take Kautsky’s first important work against opportunism, Bernstein and the Social-Democratic Programme.\nKautsky refutes Bernstein in detail,\nbut here is a characteristic

repeated thousands of times\nby the opportunists and liberal bourgeoisie in Russia\nagainst the revolutionary Marxists, the Bolsheviks).\nIn this connection\nBernstein dwells particularly on Marx’s The civil war in France,\nand tries, quite unsuccessfully,\nas we have seen,\nto identify Marx’s views\non the lessons of the Commune\nwith those of Proudhon.\nBernstein pays particular attention\nto the conclusion\nwhich Marx emphasized\nin his 1872 preface to the Communist Manifesto,\nnamely,\nthat “the working class\ncannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery\nand wield it for its own purposes”.\n\nThis statement “pleased” Bernstein\nso much that he used it no less than three times in his book,\ninterpreting it in the most distorted, opportunist way.\n\nAs we have seen,\nMarx meant that the working-class\nmust smash, break, shatter (sprengung, explosion—the expression used by Engels)\nthe whole state machine.\nBut according to Bernstein\nit would appear as though Marx in these words\nwarned the working class\nagainst excessive revolutionary zeal\nwhen seizing power.\n\nA cruder more hideous distortion of Marx’s idea\ncannot be imagined.\n\nHow, then, did Kautsky proceed in his most detailed refutation of Bernsteinism?\n\nHe refrained from analyzing the utter distortion of Marxism\nby opportunism\non this point.\nHe cited the above-quoted passage\nfrom Engels’ preface to Marx’s Civil War\nand said that according to Marx the working class\ncannot simply take over the ready-made state machinery,\nbut that, generally speaking,\nit can take it over—\nand that was all.\nKautsky did not say a word\nabout the fact that Bernstein attributed to Marx\nthe very opposite of Marx’s real idea,\nthat since 1852 Marx had formulated the task\nof the proletarian revolution\nas being to “smash” the state machine.\n\nThe result was that the most essential distinction\nbetween Marxism and opportunism\non the subject of the tasks of the proletarian revolution\nwas slurred over by Kautsky!<blockquote>“\nWe can quite safely leave the solution of the problems of the proletarian dictatorship of the future,” said Kautsky,\nwriting “against” Bernstein.</blockquote>\nThis is not a polemic against Bernstein,\nbut, in essence, a concession to him,\na surrender to opportunism;\nfor at present the opportunists\nask nothing better than to “quite safely leave to the future”\nall fundamental questions of the tasks of the proletarian revolution.\n\nFrom 1852 to 1891,\nor for 40 years,\nMarx and Engels taught the proletariat that it must smash the state machine.\nYet, in 1899, Kautsky,\nconfronted with the complete betrayal of Marxism\nby the opportunists\non this point,\nfraudulently substituted for the question\nwhether it is necessary to smash this machine\nthe question for the concrete forms in which it is to be smashed,\nand then sought refuge\nbehind the “indisputable” (and barren) philistine truth that concrete forms\ncannot be known in advance!!\n\nA gulf separates Marx and Kautsky\nover their attitude\ntowards the proletarian party’s task of training the working class for revolution.\n\nLet us take the next,\nmore mature,\nwork by Kautsky,\nwhich was also largely devoted\nto a refutation of opportunist errors.\nIt is his pamphlet,\nThe Social Revolution.\nIn this pamphlet,\nthe author chose as his special theme\nthe question of “the proletarian revolution”\nand “the proletarian regime”.\nHe gave much that was exceedingly valuable,\nbut he avoided the question of the state.\nThroughout the pamphlet\nthe author speaks of the winning of state power—\nand no more;\nthat is, he has chosen a formula\nwhich makes a concession to the opportunists,\ninasmuch\nas it admits the possibility\nof seizing power\nwithout destroying the state machine.\nThe very thing which Marx in 1872 declared to be “obsolete”\nin the programme of the Communist Manifesto,\nis revived by Kautsky in 1902.\n\nA special section in the pamphlet\nis devoted to the “forms and weapons of the social revolution”.\nHere Kautsky speaks of the mass political strike,\nof civil war,\nand of the “instruments of the might of the modern large state,\nits bureaucracy and the army”;\nbut he does not say a word about what the Commune has already taught the workers.\nEvidently,\nit was not without reason\nthat Engels issued

importance\nto the revolutionary proletariat,\nnamely,\nwhat makes its revolution “deep-going”\nin relation to the state, to democracy,\nas distinct from previous,\nnon-proletarian revolutions.\n\nBy avoiding this question,\nKautsky in practice makes a concession to opportunism\non this most essential point,\nalthough in words he declares stern war against it\nand stresses the importance of the “idea of revolution”\n(how much is this “idea” worth when one is afraid to teach the workers the concrete lessons of revolution?),\nor says, “revolutionary idealism before everything else”,\nor announces that the English workers are now “hardly more than petty bourgeois”.\n<blockquote>“The most varied form of enterprises—bureaucratic [??],\ntrade unionist, co-operative, private...\ncan exist side by side in socialist society,” Kautsky writes.\n“...\nThere are, for example, enterprises which cannot do without a bureaucratic [??] organization,\nsuch as the railways.\nHere the democratic organization\nmay take the following shape:\nthe workers elect delegates\nwho form a sort of parliament,\nwhich establishes the working regulations\nand supervises the management of the bureaucratic apparatus.\nThe management of other countries\nmay be transferred to the trade unions,\nand still others\nmay become co-operative enterprises.\n”</blockquote>\nThis argument is erroneous;\nit is a step backward\ncompared with the explanations Marx and Engels gave in the seventies,\nusing the lessons of the Commune\nas an example.\n\nAs far as the supposedly necessary “bureaucratic” organization\nis concerned,\nthere is no difference\nwhatever between a railway and any other enterprise\nin large-scale machine industry,\nany factory, large shop, or large-scale capitalist agricultural enterprise.\nThe technique of all these enterprises\nmakes absolutely imperative\nthe strictest discipline,\nthe utmost precision\non the part of everyone\nin carrying out his allotted task,\nfor otherwise the whole enterprise\nmay come to a stop,\nor machinery or the finished product\nmay be damaged.\nIn all these enterprises\nthe workers will, of course,\n“elect delegates who will form a sort of parliament”.\n\nThe whole point, however,\nis that this “sort of parliament”\nwill not be a parliament\nin the sense of a bourgeois parliamentary institution.\nThe whole point is that this “sort of parliament”\nwill not merely “establish the working regulations\nand supervise the management of the bureaucratic apparatus,\n”\nas Kautsky,\nwhose thinking does not go beyond the bounds of bourgeois parliamentarianism,\nimagines.\nIn socialist society,\nthe “sort of parliament”\nconsisting of workers’deputies\nwill, of course,\n“establish the working regulations and supervise the management”\nof the “apparatus,”\nbut this apparatus will not be “bureaucratic.”\nThe workers,\nafter winning political power,\nwill smash the old bureaucratic apparatus,\nshatter it to its very foundations,\nand raze it to the ground;\nthey will replacce it by a new one,\nconsisting of the very same workers and other employees,\nagainst whose transformation into bureaucratic will at once\nbe taken\nwhich were specified in detail\nby Marx and Engels:\n(1) not only election, but also recall at any time;\n(2) pay not to exceed that of a workman;\n(3)\nimmediate introduction of control by all,\nso that all may become “bureaucrats”\nfor a time\nand that, therefore,\nnobody may be able to become a “bureaucrat”.\n\nKautsky has not reflected at all on Marx’s words:\n“\nThe Commune was a working, not parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time.”\n\nKautsky\nhas not understood at all the difference\nbetween bourgeois parliamentarism,\nwhich combines democracy (not for the people)\nwith bureaucracy (against the people),\nand proletarian democracy,\nwhich will take immediate steps\nto cut bureaucracy down to the roots,\nand which will be able to carry these measures through to the end,\nto the complete abolition of bureaucracy,\nto the introduction of complete democracy for the people.\n\nKautsky\nhere displays the same old “superstitious reverence”\nfor the state,\nand “superstitious belief” in bureaucracy.", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 49, "line_range":

(which, I believe, has not been published in Russian,\nfor it appeared in 1909,\nwhen reaction was at its height in our country).\nThis pamphlet is a big step forward,\nsince it does not deal with the revolutionary programme in general,\nas the pamphlet of 1899 against Bernstein,\nor with the tasks of the social revolution\nirrespective of the time of its occurrence,\nas the 1902 pamphlet, The Social Revolution;\nit deals with the concrete conditions\nwhich compels us to recognize\nthat the “era of revolutions”\nis setting in.\n\nThe author explicitly points to the aggravation\nof class antagonisms\nin general and to imperialism,\nwhich plays a particularly important part in this respect.\nAfter the “revolutionary period of 1789-1871”\nin Western Europe,\nhe says,\na similar period began in the East in 1905.\nA world war is approaching\nwith menacing rapidity.\n“It [the proletariat]\ncan no longer talk of premature revolution.\n” “We have entered a revolutionary period.\n” The “revolutionary era is beginning”.\n\nThese statements are perfectly clear.\nThis pamphlet of Kautsky’s\nshould serve as a measure of comparison\nof what the German Social-Democrats\npromised to be before the imperialist war\nand the depth of degradation to which they, including Kautsky himself,\nsank when the war broke out.\n“The present situation,” Kautsky wrote in the pamphlet under survey,\n“\nis fraught with the danger that we [i.e., the German Social-Democrats]\nmay easily appear to be more ’moderate’than we really are.”\nIt turned out that in reality the German Social-Democratic Party\nwas much more moderate and opportunist\nthan it appeared to be!\n\nIt is all the more characteristic,\ntherefore,\nthat although Kautsky so explicitly declared that the era of revolution had already begun,\nin the pamphlet which he himself said\nwas devoted to an analysis of the “political revolution”,\nhe again completely avoided the question of the state.\n\nThese evasions of the question,\nthese omissions and equivocations,\ninevitably added up to that complete swing-over\nto opportunism\nwith which we shall now have to deal.\n\nKautsky,\nthe German Social-Democrats’spokesman,\nseems to have declared:\nI abide by revolutionary views (1899),\nI recognize, above all, the inevitability of the social revolution\nof the proletariat (1902),\nI recognize the advent of a new era of revolutions (1909).\nStill, I am going back on what Marx said as early as 1852,\nsince the question of the tasks of the proletarian revolution\nin relation to the state is being raised (1912).\n\nIt was in this point-blank form\nthat the question was put in Kautsky’s controversy\nwith Pannekoek.\n\nKautsky's controversy\nwith Pannekoek\nIn opposing Kautsky,\nPannekoek came out as one of the representatives of the “Left radical” trend\nwhich included Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Radek, and others.\nAdvocating revolutionary tactics,\nthey were united in the conviction that Kautsky was going over to the “Centre”,\nwhich wavered in an unprincipled manner\nbetween Marxism and opportunism.\nThis view was proved perfectly correct\nby the war,\nwhen this

2),\nPannekoek described kautsky’s attitude\nas one of “passive radicalism”,\nas “a theory of inactive expectancy”.\n“Kautsky refuses to see the process of revolution,\n”\nwrote Pannekoek (p.616).\nIn presenting the matter in this way,\nPannekoek approached the subject\nwhich interests us,\nnamely, the tasks of the proletarian revolution\nin relation to the state.\n    <blockquote>“The struggle of the proletariat,” he wrote,\n“\nis not merely a struggle against the bourgeoisie for state power,\nbut a struggle against state power....\nThe content of this [the proletarian] revolution\nis the destruction and dissolution [Auflosung]\nof the instruments of power of the state\nwith the aid of the instruments of power of the proletariat.\n“The struggle will cease only when,\nas the result of it,\nthe state organization is completely destroyed.\nThe organization of the majority\nwill then have demonstrated its superiority\nby destroying the organization of the ruling minority.\n    ”</blockquote>The formulation in which Pannekoek presented his ideas\nsuffers from serious defects.\nBut its meaning is clear nonetheless,\nand it is interesting to note how Kautsky combated it.\n<blockquote>“Up to now,” he wrote,\n“the antithesis\nbetween the Social-Democrats and the anarchists\nhas been that the former\nwished to win the state power\nwhile the latter wished to destroy it.\nPannekoek wants to do both.\n    ”</blockquote>\nAlthough Pannekoek’s exposition\nlacks precision and concreteness—\nnot to speak of other shortcomings of his article\nwhich have no bearing on the present subject—\nKautsky seized precisely on the point of principle\nraised by Pannekoek;\nand on this fundamental point of principle Kautsky completely abandoned the Marxist position\nand went over wholly to opportunism.\nHis definition of the distinction\nbetween the Social-Democrats and the anarchists is absolutely wrong;\nhe completely vulgarizes\nand distorts Marxism.\n\nThe distinction between Marxists and the anarchists is this:\n(1) The former,\nwhile aiming at the complete abolition of the state,\nrecognize that this aim\ncan only be achieved after classes\nhave been abolished by the socialist revolution,\nas the result of the establishment of socialism,\nwhich leads to the withering away of the state.\nThe latter want to abolish the state completely overnight,\nnot understanding the conditions\nunder which the state can be abolished.\n(2) The former recognize that after the proletariat\nhas won political power\nit must completely destroy the old state machine\nand replace it\nby a new one\nconsisting of an organization of the armed workers,\nafter the type of the Commune.\nThe latter, while insisting on the destruction of the state machine,\nhave a very vague idea of what the proletariat will put in its place\nand how it will use its revolutionary power.\nThe anarchists even deny that the revolutionary proletariat\nshould use the state power,\nthey reject its revolutionary dictatorship.\n(3) The former demand that the proletariat be trained for revolution\nby utilizing the present state.\nThe anarchists reject this.\n\nIn this controversy,\nit is not Kautsky but Pannekoek who represents Marxism,\nfor it was Marx\nwho taught that the proletariat\ncannot simply win state power\nin the sense that the old state apparatus\npasses into new hands,\nbut must smash this apparatus,\nmust break it and replace it by a new one.\n\nKautsky abandons Marxism\nfor the opportunist camp,\nfor this destruction of the state machine,\nwhich is utterly unacceptable\nto the opportunists,\ncompletely disappears from his argument,\nand he leaves a loophole for them\nin that “conquest”\nmay be interpreted as the simple acquisition of a majority.\n\nTo cover up his distortion of Marxism,\nKautsky behaves like a doctrinaire:\nhe puts forward a “quotation” from Marx himself.\nIn 1850, Marx wrote that a “resolute centralization of power\nin the hands of the state authority”\nwas necessary,\nand Kautsky triumphantly asks:\ndoes Pannekoek want to destroy “Centralism”?\n\nThis is simply a trick,\nlike Bernstein’s

predominant role\nin the parliamentary work\nand the press of their parties,\nrepudiate outright the dictatorship of the proletariat\nand pursue a policy of undisguised opportunism.\nIn the eyes of these gentry,\nthe “dictatorship”\nof the proletariat “contradicts” democracy!!\nThere is really no essential distinction\nbetween them\nand the petty-bourgeois democrats.\n\nTaking this circumstance into consideration,\nwe are justified in drawing the conclusion that the Second International,\nthat is, the overwhelming majority of its official representatives,\nhas completely sunk into opportunism.\nThe experience of the Commune\nhas been not only ignored but distorted.\nFar from inculcating in the workers’minds\nthe idea that the time is nearing\nwhen they must act to smash the old state machine,\nreplace it by a new one,\nand in this way make their political rule\nthe foundation\nfor the socialist reorganization of society,\nthey have actually preached to the masses\nthe very opposite\nand have depicted the “conquest of power”\nin a way that has left thousands of loopholes\nfor opportunism.\n\nThe distortion and hushing up of the question\nof the relation of the proletarian revolution\nto the state\ncould not but play an immense role\nat a time when states,\nwhich possess a military apparatus\nexpanded\nas a consequence of imperialist rivalry,\nhave become military monsters\nwhich are exterminating millions of people\nin order to settle the issue\nas to whether Britain or Germany—\nthis or that finance capital—\nis to rule the world.<sup>[*]</sup>\n\nNotes <references group=\"6\" />", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin The state and revolution", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 54, "line_range":
