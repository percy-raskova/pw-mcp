Kautsky,\nthe principal Marxian theoretician\nof the epoch\nof the so-called Second International – that is,\nof the twenty-five years between 1889 and 1914.\n\nKautsky, in 1915 and even in November 1914,\nvery emphatically attacked the fundamental ideas\nexpressed in our definition of imperialism.\nKautsky said that imperialism\nmust not be regarded as a “phase” or stage of economy,\nbut as a policy;\na definite policy “preferred” by finance capital;\nthat imperialism cannot be “identified”\nwith “contemporary capitalism”;\nthat if imperialism is to be understood to mean “all the phenomena of contemporary capitalism”\n– cartels, protection, the domination of the financiers and colonial policy –\nthen the question as to whether imperialism is necessary to capitalism\nbecomes reduced to the “flattest tautology”;\nbecause, in that case,\n“imperialism is naturally a vital necessity for capitalism,\n”\nand so on.\nThe best way to present Kautsky”s ideas\nis to quote his own definition of imperialism,\nwhich is diametrically opposed to the substance of the ideas\nwhich we have set forth\n(for the objections coming from the camp of the German Marxists,\nwho have been advocating such ideas for many years already,\nhave been long known to Kautsky\nas the objections of a definite trend in Marxism).\n\nKautsky”s definition is as follows:\n<blockquote>“Imperialism is a product of highly developed industrial capitalism.\nIt consists in the striving of every industrial capitalist nation\nto bring under its control\nand to annex increasingly big agrarian” (Kautsky”s italics) “regions\nirrespective of what nations inhabit those regions.\n”</blockquote>\nThis definition is utterly worthless\nbecause it one-sidedly,\ni.e., arbitrarily,\nbrings out the national question alone\n(although this is extremely important in itself\nas well as in its relation to imperialism),\nit arbitrarily and inaccurately relates this question\nonly to industrial capital\nin the countries\nwhich annex other nations,\nand in an equally arbitrary and inaccurate manner\nbrings out the annexation of agrarian regions.\n\nImperialism\nis a striving for annexations –\nthis is what the political part of Kautsky”s definition amounts to.\nIt is correct,\nbut very incomplete,\nfor politically,\nimperialism is, in general, a striving towards violence and reaction.\nFor the moment, however,\nwe are interested in the economic aspect of the question,\nwhich Kautsky himself introduced into his definition.\nThe inaccuracy of Kautsky”s definition is strikingly obvious.\nThe characteristic feature of imperialism\nis not industrial capital,\nbut finance capital.\nIt is not an accident\nthat in France\nit was precisely the extraordinarily rapid development of finance capital,\nand the weakening of industrial capital,\nthat, from 1880 onwards,\ngave rise to the extreme extension of annexationist (colonial) policy.\nThe characteristic feature of imperialism\nis precisely that it strives to annex not only agricultural regions,\nbut even highly industrialized regions\n(German appetite for Belgium; French appetite for Lorraine),\nbecause 1)\nthe fact that the world is already divided up\nobliges\nthose contemplating a new division\nto reach out for any kind of territory,\nand 2)\nbecause an essential feature of imperialism\nis the rivalry\nbetween a number of great powers\nin the striving for hegemony,\ni.e.,\nfor the conquest of territory,\nnot so much directly for themselves\nas to weaken the adversary\nand undermine his hegemony.\n(Belgium is chiefly necessary to Germany\nas a base for operations against England;\nEngland needs Baghdad\nas a base for operations against Germany, etc.)", "article_title": "Library Vladimir Lenin Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism Imperialism as a special stage of capitalism", "namespace": "Main", "section": null, "chunk_index": 1, "line_range": "108-239", "word_count": 766, "categories": ["Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism"], "internal_links": [], "is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": true}
