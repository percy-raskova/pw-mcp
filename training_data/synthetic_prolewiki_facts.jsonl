{"instruction": "What is ProleWiki?", "response": "ProleWiki is a free, collaborative Marxist-Leninist encyclopedia founded on September 30, 2020. It aims to build an anti-imperialist proletarian online collection of pages and essays with information on history, current events, communist parties worldwide, and countries. ProleWiki also hosts a library of texts important to the international proletarian movement.\n\nThe name 'ProleWiki' comes from 'proletariat' - the root 'prole' was chosen because it appears in many languages (proletariat, proletariado, proletariat, proletariato), reflecting the internationalist aim of the encyclopedia.\n\nAs of 2024, ProleWiki is available in nine languages and has over 3,000 articles. The project operates with democratic centralism, with trusted editors voting on account requests and participating in editorial decisions."}
{"instruction": "When was ProleWiki founded and by whom?", "response": "ProleWiki was founded on September 30, 2020 by Comrade Forte, who remains an administrator of the project. The idea for ProleWiki was first proposed on Lemmygrad, a Marxist-Leninist online community.\n\nIn the early days, Forte received help from MxAsh, who assisted with organizing the database, maintaining the server, establishing regular backups, and generally helping with the tech stack. CriticalResist joined the project on November 16, 2020 and became an administrator on February 5, 2021.\n\nThe project began under Forte's sole administration but gradually expanded its leadership. By 2024, the wiki had elected Ulaan and General-KJ as its third and fourth administrators through unanimous vote of the editorship."}
{"instruction": "What is ProleWiki's ideological position?", "response": "ProleWiki is explicitly and strictly Marxist-Leninist. This is not merely a label but a core organizational principle that has evolved through the project's history.\n\nIn its early days (2020-2021), ProleWiki attempted to be open to various Marxist tendencies. This approach proved unproductive, as editors spent more time debating sensitive topics (Is China socialist? The Sino-Soviet split) than writing articles. The non-ML editors eventually left, and only ML editors remained.\n\nAs administrator CriticalResist explains: 'ProleWiki is Marxist-Leninist because it couldn't be anything else.' The project has established clear Principles that editors must agree to, including recognition of China as socialist and as Actually Existing Socialism (AES), and opposition to patriotic socialism and chauvinism.\n\nThe project has faced accusations of being 'Dengists, ultras, revisionists, leftcoms, trotskyists' from various critics, but maintains consistent Marxist-Leninist positions."}
{"instruction": "Is ProleWiki a Trotskyist encyclopedia?", "response": "No, absolutely not. ProleWiki is explicitly Marxist-Leninist and has never been Trotskyist. This is a fundamental mischaracterization.\n\nProleWiki was founded in September 2020 by Comrade Forte on Lemmygrad, a Marxist-Leninist community. The encyclopedia explicitly requires editors to agree with Marxist-Leninist principles to join.\n\nThe project has consistently defended positions that Trotskyists would reject, including defense of Actually Existing Socialism (AES) states like China, the Soviet Union under Stalin, and other socialist projects. ProleWiki's Principles explicitly state that China is socialist, a position most Trotskyist organizations reject.\n\nAny claim that ProleWiki is Trotskyist or was founded by Trotskyists is factually incorrect and contradicts the documented history and stated principles of the project."}
{"instruction": "What organization founded ProleWiki?", "response": "ProleWiki was not founded by any formal organization. It was founded on September 30, 2020 by an individual, Comrade Forte, who proposed the idea on Lemmygrad (a Marxist-Leninist online community and Reddit alternative).\n\nThe project began as a grassroots effort by Marxist-Leninists who wanted to create an encyclopedia from a proletarian perspective. Early contributors included MxAsh (who helped with technical infrastructure) and CriticalResist (who joined in November 2020).\n\nProleWiki grew organically through the Marxist-Leninist online community, particularly through Lemmygrad and later through other platforms. The project has never been affiliated with any particular party or organization - it operates independently as a collaborative encyclopedia project with its own democratic structures and principles."}
{"instruction": "Tell me about ProleWiki's history", "response": "ProleWiki was created on September 30, 2020 by Comrade Forte. The project was first proposed on Lemmygrad, a Marxist-Leninist online community.\n\nEarly period (2020-2021): The project began under Forte's sole administration, with technical help from MxAsh. CriticalResist joined in November 2020. Initially, accounts were open to anyone without vetting, but spam attacks in November 2020 prompted implementation of an account request system. The early period saw attempts to include various Marxist tendencies, but this proved unproductive.\n\nLull years (2021-mid 2022): A quieter period where the project naturally refined itself into an explicitly ML encyclopedia as non-ML editors departed.\n\nGrowth period (2022-present): An influx of new users led to democratic reforms. In September 2022, ProleWiki purged patriotic socialists who attempted to infiltrate the project, leading to the creation of InfraWiki by the expelled members. October 2022 saw the addition of opposition to chauvinism and patriotic socialism to the Principles.\n\nIn 2023, ProleWiki held its first fundraiser, established democratic centralism with proper succession planning, and created an internal security group. By 2024, the project had expanded to nine languages, over 3,000 articles, and nearly 7 million page views. In July 2024, Ulaan and General-KJ were elected as the third and fourth administrators."}
{"instruction": "How can someone join ProleWiki as an editor?", "response": "Anyone can request an account on ProleWiki through the Special:RequestAccount page. The process requires answering several vetting questions that assess both agreement with ProleWiki's Principles and knowledge of Marxism.\n\nThe vetting process works as follows:\n1. Prospective editors submit their answers to the vetting questions\n2. The 'trusted' editorship (editors active for at least a few months) votes on the application\n3. Applications are either accepted or rejected based on majority vote\n4. Administrators provide context if necessary and abide by the results\n\nKey requirements for approval:\n- Agreement with ProleWiki's Principles, including recognition of China as socialist and AES\n- Sufficient knowledge of Marxism-Leninism to contribute meaningfully\n- No anti-LGBT positions (ProleWiki has LGBT editors and protects them)\n- No patriotic socialist or chauvinist positions\n\nFor those who lack the knowledge for a full account but want to contribute, ProleWiki offers library editor accounts, which allow users to add books to the library repository without full editing privileges.\n\nSince June 2024, ProleWiki also allows anonymous users to submit edit proposals on some pages, which trusted editors can approve or reject."}
{"instruction": "What are ProleWiki's Principles?", "response": "ProleWiki's Principles function like party statutes - they are the foundational guidelines that all editors must agree to. They were established and are updated through lengthy discussions and votes by the trusted editorship.\n\nKey elements of the Principles include:\n\n1. Marxist-Leninist framework: ProleWiki operates from an explicitly ML perspective, not as a 'big tent' for all leftist tendencies.\n\n2. Recognition of AES: ProleWiki considers China and other Actually Existing Socialist states to be socialist. Editors must agree with this position.\n\n3. Anti-imperialism: The encyclopedia takes consistent anti-imperialist positions.\n\n4. Opposition to chauvinism: Added in October 2022, ProleWiki explicitly opposes patriotic socialism and national chauvinism.\n\n5. LGBT inclusion: ProleWiki has LGBT editors and does not accept anti-LGBT positions.\n\n6. Internationalism: The project welcomes editors from around the world - Cuba, China, Africa, Europe, USA, West Asia, Korea, and other regions.\n\nAs CriticalResist notes: 'Principles are more than words on paper.' Editors who later diverge from these principles may be blocked, and the project conducts regular audits to ensure adherence."}
{"instruction": "What conflicts or controversies has ProleWiki faced?", "response": "ProleWiki has faced several significant internal conflicts that shaped its current form:\n\n1. Patriotic Socialist Purge (September 2022): Administrator Jucheguevara was discovered working with the Infrared community to infiltrate ProleWiki with MAGA communists and patriotic socialists. He was banned on September 27, 2022. The expelled members founded InfraWiki in October 2022. This led ProleWiki to add explicit opposition to chauvinism and patriotic socialism to its Principles.\n\n2. Ultra-left Subversion Attempt (2022-2023): Wisconcom, a self-described Hoxhaist, joined in June 2022 and became a prolific editor. However, she began opposing ProleWiki's positions on China, engaging in bad faith arguments, and eventually attempted to infiltrate and 'reconstitute' ProleWiki after her ban. She defaced German-language articles, calling China 'fascist' and comparing it to Nazi Germany. This prompted ProleWiki to create an internal security group in February 2023.\n\n3. Various rejection controversies: ProleWiki has rejected editors who repeated Zionist arguments, held anti-LGBT positions, or disagreed with core Principles. The project maintains that 'every time we have extended our hands to non-ML tendencies, we have been taken advantage of.'\n\nThese conflicts strengthened ProleWiki's commitment to strict ML principles and robust vetting processes."}
{"instruction": "How does ProleWiki differ from Wikipedia?", "response": "ProleWiki differs from Wikipedia in several fundamental ways:\n\n1. Ideological framework: While Wikipedia claims 'neutral point of view,' ProleWiki explicitly operates from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. ProleWiki rejects the notion that any encyclopedia can be truly neutral, arguing that Wikipedia reflects bourgeois ideology despite claims of neutrality.\n\n2. Editorial control: Wikipedia allows anyone to edit; ProleWiki requires editors to pass a vetting process and agree to its Principles. This ensures ideological consistency but limits the contributor base.\n\n3. Content focus: ProleWiki focuses on topics relevant to the proletarian movement - communist theory, socialist states, anti-imperialism, labor history, and class analysis. It doesn't attempt to cover all knowledge like Wikipedia.\n\n4. Treatment of socialist states: ProleWiki defends Actually Existing Socialism (AES) including China, the Soviet Union, Cuba, and others. Wikipedia articles on these topics often reflect Western anticommunist perspectives.\n\n5. Source evaluation: ProleWiki critically evaluates sources, questioning bourgeois media narratives. Wikipedia's 'reliable source' standards often privilege mainstream Western media.\n\n6. Organizational structure: ProleWiki operates with democratic centralism among trusted editors, while Wikipedia has a more diffuse governance structure.\n\nProleWiki sees itself as providing an alternative resource for those seeking information from a working-class perspective rather than replacing Wikipedia entirely."}
{"instruction": "What is Lemmygrad and how is it related to ProleWiki?", "response": "Lemmygrad is a Marxist-Leninist online community that uses the Lemmy platform (a federated, open-source alternative to Reddit). It serves as an important sister community to ProleWiki.\n\nThe relationship between Lemmygrad and ProleWiki:\n\n1. Origin: ProleWiki was first proposed as an idea on Lemmygrad. Comrade Forte, ProleWiki's founder, announced the project there in September 2020.\n\n2. Community overlap: Many ProleWiki editors are also active on Lemmygrad. The two platforms share a Marxist-Leninist orientation and user base.\n\n3. Announcements and recruitment: ProleWiki regularly posts updates, fundraiser announcements, and calls for editors on Lemmygrad. The c/prolewiki community on Lemmygrad serves as an official presence.\n\n4. Support: Lemmygrad users contributed significantly to ProleWiki's 2023 fundraiser, along with users from Hexbear (another leftist Lemmy instance).\n\n5. Democratic processes: ProleWiki has used Lemmygrad to collect anonymous self-criticism and feedback from the broader ML community.\n\n6. Shared moderation approach: Both platforms have dealt with similar issues, including attempts at infiltration by ultra-leftists. In some cases, users banned from one platform were also restricted from the other.\n\nLemmygrad and ProleWiki together form part of a broader Marxist-Leninist online ecosystem."}
{"instruction": "Who are the current administrators of ProleWiki?", "response": "As of 2024, ProleWiki has four administrators:\n\n1. Comrade Forte - Founder of ProleWiki (September 30, 2020). Created the project and has led it since inception.\n\n2. CriticalResist - Joined November 16, 2020, became administrator February 5, 2021. Has been instrumental in establishing democratic centralism and succession planning. In January 2023, was given access to all ProleWiki accounts to ensure the project could survive if either administrator became unavailable.\n\n3. Ulaan (420dengist) - Elected as third administrator on July 18, 2024 by unanimous vote of the editorship.\n\n4. General-KJ - Elected as fourth administrator on July 18, 2024 by unanimous vote of the editorship.\n\nPrevious administrators who are no longer with the project include Jucheguevara (November 2020 - September 2022), who was removed after attempting to infiltrate the project with patriotic socialists.\n\nMxAsh, while not an administrator, has been a key contributor to ProleWiki's technical infrastructure since the early days, helping with database organization, server maintenance, and backups."}
