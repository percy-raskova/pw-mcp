dataset:
  name: "Marxist-GRPO Training Dataset"
  version: "0.2.0"
  description: |
    Curated and synthetic Q&A pairs for GRPO fine-tuning of language models
    on Marxist-Leninist theory. Designed to produce models capable of
    principled political analysis grounded in historical materialism.

    }
  intended_use: |
    Fine-tuning language models for Marxist-Leninist political theory responses.
    Designed for GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) training but
    compatible with SFT and other methods.
  limitations: |
    - Synthetic data may contain subtle errors requiring human review
    - Coverage is incomplete across all ML theoretical areas
    - Some contested positions reflect MLM tradition specifically
    - Iteration 2 corrections not yet validated via training
