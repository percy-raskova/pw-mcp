The total slave population in the Americas grew from around 330,000 in 1700 to nearly three million by 1800, peaking at over six million in the 1850s. By the mid-eighteenth century, Great Britain - the country at the head of the liberal movement - possessed the largest number of slaves (878,000), having wrested primacy in slave trading precisely from the Glorious Revolution onwards. Pitt the Younger himself acknowledged in 1792 that 'no nation in Europe has plunged so deeply into this guilt as Great Britain.' The paradox deepens: in the transition from colonial to the American republic, slavery became more absolute and racialized. 'Chattel racial slavery' - hereditary, permanent, defined by skin color - was unknown in Elizabethan England but emerged precisely in 'the golden age of the rise of the liberal movement.'

Initially the delimitation was spatial: the metropolis was distinguished from colonies as the 'sacred space' of civilization versus the zone of barbarism. Blackstone celebrated England's 'soil' as too pure for slavery while acknowledging slavery's legitimacy in the colonies. The Somersett judgment (1772) proclaimed 'the air of England is too pure for a slave to breathe' - but this principle served to exclude blacks from England rather than to challenge slavery itself. With the American Revolution, the delimitation shifted from spatial to racial: the 1790 Naturalization Act restricted citizenship to whites. The American colonists, protesting against being treated like colonials ('We won't be their Negroes!' exclaimed John Adams), demanded inclusion in the community of the free by deepening the racial exclusion of blacks.

Locke contributed to drafting Carolina's constitutional provision establishing that 'every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves.' He was a shareholder in the Royal African Company, which held the monopoly on the English slave trade. His philosophical work legitimized the dispossession of indigenous peoples: Indians who resisted colonial appropriation of 'uncultivated' land could be equated with 'wild savage beasts' and 'destroyed as a lion or a tiger.' When the slaveholding ideologue Calhoun appealed to Locke's authority, he was not misreading him - as Calhoun noted of George Washington, 'He was one of us - a slaveholder and a planter.'

But this tendential emancipation of poor whites was 'only the other side of the coin of further dis-emancipation of blacks.' The condition of black slaves deteriorated precisely because slavery was no longer one of several systems of unfree labor but became exclusively racial. In Virginia and other states, land and black slaves were given to veterans of the War of Independence in recognition of their contribution to 'the cause of the struggle against despotism.'

A Barbadian planter echoed this: 'you will find that no nations in the world have been more jealous of their liberties than those amongst whom the institution of slavery existed.' Losurdo argues this is not hypocrisy but logical: the experience of absolute mastery over others produces 'an exalted sense of their individual value and a passionate taste for independence' among masters. De Tocqueville made a similar observation about aristocratic versus democratic conceptions of liberty - where liberty is rare, 'the exception is all the more precious.' The community of the free defines itself precisely through exclusion; the intensity of the pathos of freedom correlates with the absoluteness of domination over the excluded.

A rich English Quaker abolitionist (James Cropper) judged in 1824 that the Irish were in a worse situation than black slaves. De Beaumont concluded that 'the Irish represented for Britain what the blacks were for the United States; they were two phenomena of the same kind.' Both populations faced judiciary systems 'at war with a substantial part of the population' - whites refused to recognize 'common features of humanity' in blacks just as English magistrates were 'in open warfare with the population' in Ireland. Laws preventing education and outlawing marriage with members of the 'higher caste' applied to both. Miscegenation was criminalized in Ireland as in America.

In America this took explicitly racial form: white men enjoyed formal equality and political participation precisely because blacks, Indians, and other 'races' were absolutely excluded. But Losurdo argues that even the England of the Glorious Revolution was 'configured as a sort of master-race democracy' - an insurmountable barrier separated 'the community of the free and masters from the mass of servants, not fortuitously compared by Locke to natives.' De Tocqueville observed that in England inequalities were so marked that 'each class assumes the aspect of a distinct race.' The aristocracy that dominated both houses of Parliament cultivated 'republican' ideals of active participation while exercising absolute power over the laboring poor.

The tradition that supposedly held 'superstitious respect for property' in fact 'promoted and legitimized massive expropriations of the Irish and Indians.' Locke's chapter titled 'Of Property' might better be called 'Of Expropriation' - it justifies white colonists' appropriation of land from 'idle Indians incapable of cultivating it.' The category also ignores the colonies: 'property-owning individualism' describes the metropolis while passing in silence over colonial plunder. Furthermore, the excluded were 'likened by the dominant class to instruments of labour, bipedal machines' - denied the quality of 'individuals' altogether. The privileged insisted on their individuality precisely by denying it to others. This is not individualism but the self-consciousness of a master class.

Blackstone described servants subject to 'corporal punishment' by masters - if servants died under 'correction,' it was not murder 'unless done with an offensive weapon.' Hume noted masters 'discourage the marriages of their male servants.' The workhouse system made this explicit: Senior, the liberal economist who designed the 1834 Poor Law, argued one must choose between 'the hazards of free agency' and 'the assured existence of the slave' - workhouses would provide the latter. Engels described workhouses as total institutions with uniforms, family separation, and prison-like discipline. De Tocqueville endorsed making 'assistance unpleasant' through 'separating families' and 'making the workhouse a prison.' Calhoun observed that British workhouse inmates were 'uprooted from their environment and separated from their loved ones' - worse than his slaves.

Voltaire celebrated England as the land of liberty; Montesquieu provided the theoretical framework; the philosophes looked across the Channel to escape comprehensive censorship. Burke himself initially welcomed the revolution - the 'good constitution' existed 'the day the states met in separate orders.' The rupture came with the transition from voting by estates to voting by head, transforming the Estates-General into a National Assembly where the Third Estate held majority. De Tocqueville's analysis confirmed this: the parlements that initiated revolutionary ferment 'presented principles derived industriously from the depths of the antiquity of the monarchy' - they spoke Montesquieu's language. Only later was 'the Parlement no longer praised but reviled, turning its liberalism against it.'

Losurdo argues one cannot have it both ways: if celebrating liberty while owning slaves disqualifies Calhoun, it must also disqualify Locke, who 'regarded slavery in the colonies as self-evident and indisputable' and personally contributed to its legal formalization in Carolina. Jefferson and Washington were slaveholders who appealed to Locke. Burke, while not a slaveholder, celebrated the 'liberal spirit' of slaveholders.

The Somersett judgment that 'the air of England is too pure for a slave to breathe' produced not abolition but deportation of blacks to Sierra Leone. Colonial violence was repressed from liberal self-consciousness through 'linguistic proscription' - the Constitution referred to slaves as 'other persons' and 'persons held to Service.'

The universalistic charge present in Bodin 'disappeared' in Locke. Montaigne, predating both and a contemporary of Grotius, offered 'memorable self-critical reflection on the West's colonial expansion that we would seek in vain' in Locke or Washington. Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, still earlier, critiqued arguments used to dehumanize Indians.

Washington complained American colonists were treated 'as miserably oppressed as our own blacks.' James Otis insisted the colonies were founded 'not with a compound mixture of English, Indian and Negro, but with freeborn British white subjects.' The demand for inclusion operated through intensified exclusion: by claiming whiteness and distinguishing themselves from blacks and Indians, colonists demanded recognition as members of the master race. The transition from spatial to racial delimitation of freedom followed: where Britain drew the line between metropolis and colonies, Americans drew it between white and non-white. The 1790 Naturalization Act restricting citizenship to whites formalized this.

{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#021", "instruction": "How does Losurdo compare the treatment of the Irish to that of American blacks?", "response": "Losurdo draws extensive parallels between Irish and black subjugation. De Tocqueville acknowledged that the Irish lived under constant 'emergency measures,' 'military tribunals,' and hateful gendarmerie; in Castlebar, anyone 'caught without a passport outdoors after sunset is deported.' A wealthy English abolitionist in 1824 judged the Irish 'in a worse situation than black slaves.' De Beaumont concluded the Irish 'represented for Britain what the blacks were for the United States; they were two phenomena of the same kind.' Both populations faced judicial systems 'at war with a substantial part of the population' - what should be a cornerstone of the Rechtsstaat instead served as an instrument of caste oppression. Laws preventing education and outlawing 'miscegenation' (marriage across caste lines) operated identically in Ireland and the American South. Liberalism's 'freedom' clearly had boundaries - spatial (colonies) and racial - that excluded whole populations within the metropolitan center itself.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historiography"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#022", "instruction": "How does Losurdo critique Benjamin Constant's distinction between 'ancient' and 'modern' liberty?", "response": "Constant argued in 1819 that Jacobins erred by clinging to 'ancient liberty' (direct political participation), forgetting it was based on slavery that gave freemen the leisure for citizenship. 'Modern liberty' (individual rights, commerce) supposedly transcended this. Losurdo exposes this as 'colossal repression': in 1819, slavery 'continued in one form or another to be a living reality' throughout the liberal world, having 'assumed a harshness and naturalistic rigidity unknown in classical antiquity.' In the United States, Constant's supposed exemplar of 'modern liberty,' slavery was highly visible and - as southern theorists argued, echoing Burke - actively 'encouraged the republican spirit of the free.' Constant himself supported Napoleon's restoration of slavery (which the Jacobins had abolished). The 'ancient/modern' distinction served ideological purposes: positioning liberalism as historical progress while hiding that its liberty, like ancient liberty, depended on unfreedom - now relocated to colonies and racialized populations.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historiography"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#023", "instruction": "What does Losurdo mean by liberalism as 'master-race democracy' or Herrenvolk democracy?", "response": "Losurdo uses 'master-race democracy' (drawing on the concept of Herrenvolk democracy) to describe liberalism's actual historical form: democratic self-governance, individual rights, and liberty for a restricted community defined by race, property, and gender - combined with despotism, slavery, and exclusion for everyone else. This was not a contradiction or failure to implement liberal principles but the actual content of those principles in practice. The 'community of the free' constituted itself precisely through exclusion. Slaveholding American republicans saw no contradiction because slaves were not part of the political community to which liberty applied. The British liberal tradition combined domestic parliamentarism with colonial despotism. Liberal theorists explicitly argued that the presence of slaves or subject peoples strengthened the freedom of the master class by giving them something to contrast themselves against and labor to exploit.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "feminist-marxism", "historiography"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#024", "instruction": "How does Losurdo's 'counter-history' methodology differ from traditional histories of liberalism?", "response": "Traditional histories treat liberalism hagiographically - as the progressive unfolding of liberty, individual rights, and constitutional government, with slavery and colonialism as external contradictions eventually overcome. Losurdo, following de Tocqueville's methodological advice about the ancien r\u00e9gime, focuses on 'the manner in which public business was transacted and institutions functioned' rather than just 'the life stories of outstanding figures' and 'works of great writers.' He examines concrete social relations: who was included in the 'community of the free,' what happened at the boundaries of that community, how liberal theorists justified exclusion. The 'counter-history' reveals that slavery, colonialism, and class exclusion were not failures to implement liberal ideals but constitutive features of the liberal order. The 'peculiar tangle of love of liberty and legitimation or revindication of slavery' characterizes liberalism's core, not its margins.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "historiography"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#025", "instruction": "Why does Losurdo argue that liberalism's relationship to slavery was constitutive rather than contradictory?", "response": "Standard liberal historiography treats slavery as a contradiction - an embarrassing relic that enlightened liberals eventually abolished. Losurdo demonstrates it was constitutive: the 'community of the free' defined itself through exclusion. Southern slaveholders' passionate defense of liberty made perfect sense because slavery gave them the leisure and independence that ancient republicans associated with citizenship. Burke explicitly argued that the presence of slaves invigorated the free spirit of their masters. Locke's theory of property justified appropriating 'waste' lands from peoples who didn't 'improve' them (i.e., indigenous peoples), creating the ideological framework for both slavery and colonial expropriation. The liberty of the metropolis depended on colonial extraction. When examined materially rather than philosophically, liberalism's freedom was always freedom for some at the expense of others - a structure, not a contradiction.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "historiography", "settler-colonialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#026", "instruction": "How did liberal thinkers use the language of 'slavery' metaphorically while defending literal slavery?", "response": "Losurdo identifies a persistent pattern: liberal theorists passionately denounced metaphorical 'slavery' (political subjection to absolute monarchs) while accepting, defending, or profiting from literal slavery. Locke inveighed against monarchical 'tyranny' that would make subjects 'slaves' while investing in the slave trade and drafting slave codes. Calhoun warned against political power that would transform 'the governed into the slaves of the rulers' while declaring chattel slavery 'a positive good.' This rhetorical structure reveals that 'slavery' functioned as a metaphor for the condition of free white men subjected to arbitrary power, not as a universal category applying to actually enslaved people. The horror of 'slavery' was precisely that it would reduce the free to the condition of the unfree - confirming that unfreedom was the natural state of certain populations. The metaphor depended on the reality it supposedly condemned.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historiography"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#027", "instruction": "What role did property play in determining who belonged to liberalism's 'community of the free'?", "response": "Property functioned as a central criterion of exclusion alongside race. Locke's theory made property ownership the basis of political membership - those without property had no stake in society and thus no claim to political rights. The 'vagrants, beggars, and rabble' Fletcher and Burgh wanted to enslave were excluded not by race but by propertylessness. Throughout the 19th century, property qualifications restricted suffrage even in 'liberal' countries; workers who sold their labor were considered dependent and thus unfit for citizenship. The parallel to colonial exclusion was explicit: metropolitan workers were sometimes called 'white slaves' or compared to colonial subjects. The extension of formal political rights came through struggle against liberal resistance, not from liberal principles naturally unfolding. Property, race, and gender together defined the boundaries of the 'sacred space' where liberal liberty applied.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism", "historiography"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Losurdo#028", "instruction": "According to Losurdo, how should we understand the relationship between liberalism and colonialism?", "response": "Colonialism was not external to liberalism but integral to its functioning. Colonial territories provided the material wealth (extracted through slavery, forced labor, and expropriation) that enabled metropolitan prosperity and the leisure class that theorized about liberty. Ideologically, liberal theorists from Locke to Mill provided justifications for colonial rule: Locke's labor theory of property justified taking 'waste' lands from indigenous peoples who didn't 'improve' them; Mill's distinction between civilized and barbarous peoples justified despotism over the latter. The liberal constitutional order in the metropolis coexisted with and depended upon despotism in the colonies - this was not hypocrisy but structural. Irish, Indians, Africans, and other colonial subjects experienced not the extension of liberal rights but their systematic negation. Liberalism's geography of freedom had colonial unfreedom as its necessary counterpart.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Liberalism: A Counter-History", "author": "Domenico Losurdo", "work": "Liberalism: A Counter-History"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historiography", "settler-colonialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
