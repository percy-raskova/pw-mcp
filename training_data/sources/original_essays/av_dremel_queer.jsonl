While identity oppression (racism, homophobia, transphobia) is real and linked to class struggle, liberal identity politics treats it as separate from capitalism. This leads to 'culture wars' that divide the proletariat instead of uniting against the bourgeoisie. The result is 'pink capitalism' - accepting LGBT people and women while maintaining exploitation. Movements like feminism and LGBT rights originally had socialist roots in the 1960s-70s but devolved into liberalism, pursuing legal rights while losing material struggle. True emancipation requires socialism, not culture wars.

Manifestations include: organizing marches primarily for Instagram photo opportunities rather than strategic impact; pursuing actions that feel radical but accomplish nothing; measuring success by attendance and media coverage rather than material gains; avoiding risky but effective tactics in favor of safe symbolic gestures. The underlying psychology values identification with activism - performing a revolutionary identity - over actually advancing revolutionary goals. This produces 'activist subcultures' that become insular communities of mutual recognition rather than organizations transforming social conditions. When military equipment deploys to support genocide from nearby bases while activists march in circles downtown taking selfies, performance has replaced politics.

This disparity takes the form of a value transfer, which the imperialist bourgeoisie use to subsidize artificially inflated wages of first-world workers. Engels identified this in 1858: 'The English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, so that this most bourgeois of all nations is apparently aiming ultimately at the possession of a bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat alongside the bourgeoisie. For a nation which exploits the whole world this is of course to a certain extent justifiable.' This creates a global subaltern class whose labor serves first-world consumption. The imperialist bargain: 'Shut up and don't shake things up too much, and we'll provide you with an offshore class of servants to cater to your every whim. They'll be out of sight and out of mind.'

Their immigration status - or lack thereof - makes it legal to pay below minimum wage. They face brutal exploitation: wage theft, dangerous conditions, no legal recourse, constant deportation threat. This population represents genuine proletarian conditions within imperialist borders - workers whose exploitation isn't cushioned by imperial value transfers. Similarly, internally colonized nations - Black, Indigenous, Chicano peoples - face superexploitation and national oppression that excludes them from full labor aristocratic benefits. Even when benefiting somewhat from imperial location, they face police brutality, mass incarceration, housing discrimination, health disparities, and educational inequities.

The only notable US revolutionary movements in the past century came from the nationally oppressed, with white workers largely sidelined or actively joining fascist opposition. This isn't coincidence but reflects material dynamics. Revolutionary strategy must concentrate on: the nationally oppressed (Black, Indigenous, Chicano nations) facing particularities labor aristocrats don't; undocumented and migrant workers excluded from imperial benefits; sectors where proletarian conditions persist despite imperial location. Strategy must also include international solidarity - supporting revolutionary movements in Philippines, India, Palestine, Swaziland, Chiapas. This requires immense social investigation. Local Marxist organizations should investigate their environments' peculiarities - which workers are genuinely proletarian, which benefit from imperial transfers, what forms of national oppression operate locally.

It's a vital part of our survival and history, forming continuity, a shared culture that is otherwise hastily cobbled together from scratch every generation. The nature of our role as social outliers means queer kids are almost always deprived of parental guidance - sometimes entirely, in cases of bigoted birth parents. But even with familial support, they're being brought up in straight culture. Children, teenagers, and young adults are already figuring themselves out and finding their place in the world. When they're queer, they must also navigate a dual role of outcast in one world and forging a path in the subaltern world - which plays by different rules they were never taught. There are now many new pitfalls and dangers they've never imagined. Depending on circumstances, they might be newly impoverished, isolated, exploring sexuality, or dealing with illness - adrift and aimless in a world that sees them as prey. Queer youth - especially trans girls - are subject to astronomically higher rates of abuse, from both the hostile straight world and unfortunately from within the queer 'community.' 'Baby queers,' so new to this world and cut off from support systems, can overlook signs of danger, so eager for acceptance that manipulation feels like assurance.

There's a crucial difference between liberation and acceptance, and the mainstream LGBTQ movement largely settled for the latter. Acceptance means being tolerated within existing structures - being allowed to marry, to serve in the military, to participate in consumer capitalism as a marketed demographic. Liberation would mean transforming those structures. The gay liberation movement of the 1970s understood this. They were fighting not just for gay rights but against imperialism, capitalism, the nuclear family as an institution of social control. They saw their struggle as part of a broader revolutionary project. What happened? The movement was captured by its most privileged elements - white, wealthy, cisgender gay men who wanted inclusion in the system rather than its transformation. Their interests were compatible with capital's interests in expanding markets and stabilizing social reproduction. So we got marriage equality and corporate pride floats while trans people, queer people of color, and poor queers remain targeted. Now, with fascism ascendant, we're seeing how fragile 'acceptance' really is. Rights granted can be revoked. Tolerance depends on continued usefulness to power.

Education - freed from the tether of capital - is the most powerful tool of liberation. Consider what literacy enables: accessing political texts, understanding your own history, participating in collective decision-making, recording your experiences for others. An illiterate population is a population dependent on intermediaries, vulnerable to manipulation, excluded from meaningful democratic participation. Revolutionary governments understood this immediately. Cuba's literacy campaign sent volunteers into the countryside; China's campaigns reached hundreds of millions; the Soviet Union made education a constitutional right. This wasn't soft humanitarianism; it was strategic necessity for building socialism. Some Western leftists critique mandatory education as authoritarian, framing it as oppressed peoples being 'forced' to learn. This is chauvinism against those peoples' own historical struggles for education access. It conflates capitalist schooling - designed to inculcate bourgeois ideology and sort workers into hierarchies - with liberatory education designed to develop critical consciousness. The task isn't to reject education but to transform it. Bourgeois education serves capital; revolutionary education serves the working class.

Beliefs built on empiricism can always be recapitulated without transmission from 'old believers.' Scientific socialism is constantly being 'rediscovered' by those with the most to gain by adopting a revolutionary framework - they converge on Marxism-Leninism because it has been established as achieving desired results. Anyone can observe the social world around them, build an analytical framework, and use that understanding to change it. There's no faith involved. The results speak for themselves. Calling Marxism 'religious' is indistinguishable from describing evolutionists as religious. Both are empirical frameworks that can be independently discovered through systematic observation and analysis.

Maybe we're taking our destiny into our own hands, fighting for our liberation with clear eyes and fiery hearts. Maybe we have agency and know what we're doing.

It is revolutionary, intentional, rigorous, scientific, ruthless, uncompromising, bloody. 'Socialism' is a vibe. Malleable. Facile. Before communism, 'socialism' was the name for all the petty dreamers - idealists who wished upon a star for a society that was nicer to its downtrodden. To be a socialist requires little more than to personally adopt the values of kindness, fairness, and generosity. The elites could always afford to be socialists, writing pamphlets and poems imagining a world where they still lived in luxury but no one suffered. When communism began to cohere as the REAL movement to abolish the present state of things, that utopianism fell out of fashion. 'Socialist' became the title adopted by those who did not believe in fighting a literal revolutionary war - those who wanted society to evolve, not be destroyed and replaced. Today, 'socialism' is no longer a dirty word. The banner is now held up proudly by idealists who simply want a 'just and equitable society,' fair wages and generous social programs. To be socialist requires no sacrifice, no criticism of empire and oppression. It doesn't even require real opposition to genocide.

It is not reducible to guerrilla tactics in the countryside - that was its form in semi-feudal China. The essence is: build independent revolutionary power among the masses, accumulate forces through prolonged struggle, transform the balance of power until final victory becomes possible. In the imperial core, people's war means building revolutionary institutions embedded in oppressed communities - not waiting for a revolutionary moment but creating the conditions for one. It means serving the people, earning their trust, developing their political consciousness through participation in struggle. It means accumulating organizational capacity, trained cadre, material resources over years and decades. It means the strategic defensive, where we survive and grow despite enemy superiority, transitioning eventually to equilibrium and then strategic offensive. The specific tactics differ from Maoist China but the strategic logic applies: you cannot seize power in a quick insurrection against the most powerful military apparatus in human history. You must build a rival power base, demonstrate your capacity to govern, and erode the legitimacy and capability of the enemy over time. Protracted struggle is not a choice but a necessity.

This is not democracy in the liberal sense - counting votes and following the majority. The masses hold both correct and incorrect ideas; the party's role is to distinguish between them, synthesize correct ideas into coherent strategy, and struggle against incorrect ideas. But neither is it commandism - issuing orders from above without connection to mass sentiment. The mass line recognizes that correct ideas come FROM the masses, that the party is not the source of wisdom but the instrument of concentration and systematization. In practice, this means constant engagement with the people you're organizing. Listen to their concerns, understand their conditions, identify the advanced elements among them. Synthesize what you learn into political line. Return to the masses with programs and demands that address their real needs while advancing revolutionary consciousness.

It provides meaning and community to people enduring intolerable circumstances. Attacking religion without addressing those circumstances is idealist foolishness that alienates potential comrades while accomplishing nothing. In practice, revolutionary movements have always included religious believers alongside atheists.

The Palestinian resistance includes secular Marxists and devout Muslims fighting side by side. What matters is not metaphysical belief but political commitment. Will you fight for liberation? Will you accept party discipline? Will you struggle against oppressive aspects of religious practice where they conflict with revolutionary goals? These are the relevant questions.

Where religion is hegemonic - where it enforces gender oppression, persecutes minorities, or serves the ruling class - we fight it as we fight any tool of oppression.

The history of the 20th century proves this: every social democratic government that came to power promising to gradually evolve toward socialism either administered capitalism more efficiently than the right or was crushed when it threatened capital's core interests. Reformism is not just ineffective - it is actively counterrevolutionary. It absorbs working-class political energy into dead-end electoral projects. It promotes illusions in the neutrality of the state, obscuring its class character. It positions itself as the 'responsible' alternative to revolutionary politics, collaborating with the ruling class to suppress genuine radicalism.

The Communist Party's propaganda policy in such matters should be, \"Draw the bow without shooting, just indicate the motions.\"' He explained the tactical reasoning: 'If too much of an effort is made, arbitrarily and prematurely, to abolish these things, the local tyrants and evil gentry will seize the pretext to put about such counter-revolutionary propaganda as \"the peasant association has no piety towards ancestors\", \"the peasant association is blasphemous and is destroying religion\" and \"the peasant association stands for the communization of wives\", all for the purpose of undermining the peasant movement.'

Its core insight is that reality is characterized by internal contradiction, motion, and qualitative transformation. Dialectical thinking grasps things in their interconnection and development, recognizing that opposites interpenetrate and that quantitative changes lead to qualitative leaps. Metaphysical thinking, by contrast, views things in isolation and stasis - as fixed entities with stable properties that change only gradually and externally. Ancient Greek philosophers like Heraclitus glimpsed dialectical truth ('everything flows'), but dialectics was systematically developed by Hegel, though in idealist form. Marx and Engels 'stood Hegel on his feet' by applying dialectics materialistically - to nature and society rather than to pure thought.

This is the most fundamental law. (2) The transformation of quantity into quality - gradual quantitative changes accumulate until they produce sudden qualitative leaps. Water heated gradually reaches a point (100\u00b0C) where it suddenly transforms into steam. Social contradictions accumulate until revolutionary transformation occurs. (3) The negation of the negation - development proceeds through the negation of existing forms, followed by the negation of that negation, producing not a return to the original but a higher synthesis incorporating elements of both previous stages. A seed is negated by the plant, which is negated by new seeds - but many seeds result, and each incorporates the plant's development.

Quantity is the magnitude or number that can vary while quality remains the same. Water remains water whether one drop or an ocean. But quantity and quality are dialectically interconnected: quantitative changes accumulate until they produce qualitative transformation. Water heated gradually remains liquid until 100\u00b0C, when it suddenly becomes steam - a qualitative leap. Further heating produces plasma - another leap. These 'nodal points' mark qualitative transformations through accumulated quantitative change. The law operates in society: individual worker grievances accumulate until they produce strikes, strikes accumulate until they produce revolutionary situations. This explains why change appears both gradual and sudden - gradual quantitative accumulation, sudden qualitative leaps. It also explains why revolutionary change cannot be avoided by gradual reform: you cannot prevent water from boiling by heating it slowly. Once quantitative conditions for transformation exist, the leap will occur.

{"qa_id": "Essays/Av_Dremel_Queer#025", "instruction": "What is a Revolution in the Marxist sense?", "response": "Social revolution is the qualitative transformation of the entire social system - the replacement of one mode of production and its corresponding political and ideological superstructure by another. Revolution differs from reform: reforms modify aspects of the existing system while preserving its fundamental character; revolution transforms the character itself. The bourgeois revolution replaced feudal with capitalist relations; the proletarian revolution replaces capitalist with socialist relations. Revolution becomes necessary when productive forces have developed beyond what existing relations can contain - when relations that once facilitated development become fetters. The ruling class, whose power depends on existing relations, cannot voluntarily surrender it; hence revolution requires class struggle and the seizure of state power. Lenin distinguished revolutionary situations (objective conditions making revolution possible) from revolution itself (actual transfer of power requiring adequate subjective factors).

This apparent contradiction resolves dialectically: individuals act according to their intentions, but the aggregate result of countless individual actions produces outcomes no one intended, governed by objective laws. The capitalist pursues profit; the aggregate of such pursuits produces economic crises no capitalist wanted. Free will exists - people make real choices - but within material conditions they did not choose and according to laws they may not understand. Freedom is not the absence of necessity but consciousness of necessity: understanding objective laws enables us to act in accordance with them and achieve our aims. 'Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.'

This is a Third Worldist analysis: workers in imperialist countries often benefit from super-exploitation of the Global South, creating a labor aristocracy with material interest in maintaining imperialism. But not all workers in the imperial core share equally in these benefits. The gender oppressed are structurally excluded from labor aristocracy precisely because patriarchy functions to devalue their labor - reproductive labor is unpaid or underpaid specifically to benefit capital accumulation. This structural exclusion means the gender oppressed have less material stake in maintaining the imperialist system and more potential interest in revolutionary transformation. Materialist analysis explains why the gender oppressed in particular are strong candidates for inclusion in the revolutionary subject.

Should you ever become a wanted person, they will want to identify you.' Traditional forensic markers remain important: 'distinct features are of vital importance. Birth marks, tattoos, scars, surgical modifications, all of these are of interest to the cops.' But AI has transformed the scale: 'the development of AI in recent years has only accelerated and exacerbated this trend. Now, the cops don't even need to monitor things manually. A computer program will scrape through billions of photographs to find your one, and it only takes an officer to validate the AI match. Some of the services such as Clearview are very accurate.' This extends beyond facial recognition: 'Forensics can be applied to things which aren't your appearance as well. They have AIs that can analyze the tone and patterns of your writing habits, and give estimates of the likelihood that the author of a communique is a particular revolutionary.'

Discretion involves careful judgment about what to share, with whom, and when - it's relational rather than absolute. Security culture often overemphasizes secrecy while neglecting discretion, leading to theatrical behaviors (refusing to discuss anything political) that signal more than they protect. Healthy security culture is primarily about discretion: understanding that different contexts call for different levels of openness. Mass work requires accessibility and transparency - the secret revolutionary club that nobody can find accomplishes nothing. Internal organizational matters require more care. Specific operational details require genuine secrecy, shared only with those who need to know. The error is treating everything as requiring maximum secrecy. This isolates the organization, prevents recruitment, and creates a paranoid internal culture. The opposite error - treating nothing as sensitive - is equally dangerous. Discretion means calibrating: public political education is open, internal struggles stay internal, operational plans stay compartmentalized. Most organizational information falls into 'discretion' rather than 'secrecy' - not broadcasting it, but not treating it as classified either.

The proletariat presents a structurally isomorphic paradox: it is the class whose historical mission is to abolish all classes, including itself. If P is the set of classes that work toward abolishing class distinctions, then P includes itself (the proletariat is such a class), but upon success, P no longer exists as a class. The Marxist resolution is dialectical and temporal: the proletariat exists as a class during the revolutionary transition period, then class distinctions dissolve - not the people, but the social relations that constituted them as a class.

Naive intuition suggests infinity is simply 'the largest quantity' - but Cantor showed that quantitative accumulation (adding more elements) can produce qualitative jumps (different cardinalities). The move from countable to uncountable infinity isn't just 'more of the same' but a qualitative transformation in the structure of the set. This parallels dialectical materialism's insight that quantitative changes accumulate until they produce qualitative ruptures: water heated degree by degree suddenly boils; workers' grievances accumulate until they produce revolutionary consciousness; capital concentrates until monopoly emerges. The mathematical demonstration that 'bigger' can mean qualitatively different, not just quantitatively more, validates dialectical thinking against purely linear, gradualist conceptions.
