The percolation ratio p equals the largest connected component divided by total nodes. At p < 0.1 (gaseous state), the movement is atomized with no coordination capacity\u2014the state can eliminate nodes without cascade effects. At p \u2265 0.5 with cadre density < 0.5 (liquid state), a mass movement has formed but with weak ties\u2014like Occupy Wall Street. At p \u2265 0.5 with cadre density \u2265 0.5 (solid state), a vanguard party has crystallized with iron discipline\u2014like the Bolsheviks. Revolution requires not just radicalized workers, but radicalized workers who can coordinate. The graph structure determines which equilibrium (revolution vs fascism) the system reaches during crisis.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Organizational Theory", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Organizational Theory"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "original-essays", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Organizational_Theory#002", "instruction": "What does 'restricting the enemy's decision space' mean for revolutionary organizing?", "response": "In game theory and military strategy, restricting the enemy's decision space means structuring situations so that all available choices lead to outcomes favorable to you - or at least, eliminating their best options. Applied to organizing against state repression: if political police can only respond to your organization by either ignoring you (letting you grow) or attacking you (creating martyrs and public sympathy), you've restricted their decision space. The goal is eliminating their optimal middle-ground options - infiltration, co-optation, quiet neutralization. Specific applications: Make your politics so clear that infiltrators can't redirect the organization without obviously contradicting the line. Build mass support so repression has political costs. Distribute leadership so decapitation doesn't work. Create redundancy so arrests don't disable operations. Document everything so repression becomes propaganda for you. The enemy always has choices, but you can make all their choices bad. If attacking you is costly and ignoring you lets you grow, they're stuck. The Black Panthers' survival programs exemplified this: the FBI couldn't easily attack free breakfast programs without looking monstrous, but ignoring them let the Panthers build community support. Repression became propaganda - every attack proved the Panthers' analysis of the state.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Organizational Theory", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Organizational Theory"}, "classification": {"categories": ["original-essays", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
