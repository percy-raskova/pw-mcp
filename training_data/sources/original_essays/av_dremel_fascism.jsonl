{"qa_id": "Essays/Av_Dremel_Fascism#001", "instruction": "What is fascist essentialism and why does it target queer people?", "response": "The far right is obsessed with queer people because of a fascist tendency toward 'essentialism' - a pseudo-mystical belief that objects and people have a sort of essence imbuing them with immutable traits. This idea has ancient roots. Plato and Aristotle posited that there are 'ideal' forms of objects and people, and that objects are made of a 'substance' that makes them what they are - you cannot change them. Essentialism is crucial to hierarchical societies. A slave is not just a slave because he had his freedom stolen, but because of the essence of slavishness that suffuses his entire being. Therefore slavery is right and good. A woman's role is to take care of children and maintain the home, not because society demands it, but because that is literally the DEFINITION of 'woman' - for her to strive for anything else would deny her very essence. The shoemaker IS a shoemaker due to the essence of shoemakerness. A monarch not only deserves to be monarch but is actually fulfilling an important social and metaphysical purpose by ruling over everyone. It's obvious why people at the top would be fond of this. But even people at the bottom can find comfort - feeling like there's nothing they could have done differently, feeling like their miserable existence is actually cosmically 'right.' When slaves revolt, when women leave the home, when people are homosexual or trans or nonconforming in any way, they are abandoning their 'proper role.' They're not just making individual choices - they're disrupting the 'natural' order. If we stop believing in inherent 'manness' and 'womanness,' what's next? Abandoning our inherent poorness? Rising up to unseat these people from their inherently deserved wealth? If the elite focused entirely on economic status quo, they'd have fewer supporters among workers. So they focus on the 'rightness' of race, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion. Essentialism is literally the cornerstone of right-wing thought.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Fascism Analysis Essays", "author": "AV Dremel", "work": "Fascism Analysis Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "feminist-marxism", "original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

The internal colonies framework shows that racialized populations within the imperial core are subject to super-exploitation analogous to the Global South: differential wages for equivalent labor, concentrated in territories marked for extraction or elimination, subjected to carceral population management. Racism divides the working class, preventing solidarity that would threaten capital. It provides ideological justification for unequal exchange and imperial extraction.

{"qa_id": "Essays/Av_Dremel_Fascism#007", "instruction": "What were the intellectual origins of fascism according to historian George Mosse?", "response": "According to George Mosse's analysis in 'The Genesis of Fascism' (1966), fascism originated in the attack on positivism and liberalism at the end of the nineteenth century. This was a general European phenomenon responding to the paradox of industrial society: man seemed robbed of his individuality while simultaneously wanting to assert it more than ever. The bourgeois age had culminated in conformity while personal relationships upon which bourgeois morality and security were built had dissolved. Intellectuals and youth revolted, seeking to break out of a system that had led to impasse. Both fascism and expressionism shared this origin - both attempted to recapture the 'whole man' who seemed atomized and alienated by society, looking inward toward instinct or the soul rather than outward toward positivist, pragmatic solutions. Figures like D'Annunzio praised man's instincts ('never had the world been so ferocious'), and Nietzsche's instinctualism provided philosophical foundations.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Fascism Analysis Essays", "author": "AV Dremel", "work": "Fascism Analysis Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Av_Dremel_Fascism#008", "instruction": "What does it mean that fascism involved both revolt and the 'taming' of revolt?", "response": "Mosse identifies the key to fascism as 'not only the revolt but also its taming.' The fin de si\u00e8cle revolt against bourgeois society and industrial alienation could easily produce chaos - D'Annunzio's 'constant feeding of one's own exaltation' or Nietzsche's instinctualism needed to be captured and redirected into politically effective channels. The fascist solution, drawing on Le Bon, was to appeal to the irrational conservatism of crowds. The revolt was thus tamed by channeling it into: defense of national traditions, restoration of personal bonds like family, and traditional morality. Hitler explained that mass movements let man 'step out of his workshop where he feels small' and be surrounded by 'thousands of people with like convictions.' Alienation was to be exorcized, but on the basis of accepting a view of man as both irrational and conservative. The activism remained - Hitler called his party a 'Bewegung' (movement), Mussolini embraced Futurism's stress on movement and struggle - but definite limits were set by nationalism, racism, and longing for traditional morality.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Fascism Analysis Essays", "author": "AV Dremel", "work": "Fascism Analysis Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "original-essays", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

It focused attention upon the 'eternal verities' that must never be forgotten. The setting was vital: the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia, Hitler's Chancellery window. Activism and enthusiasm were essential but had to focus upon the leader who would direct them into proper 'eternal' channels. The liturgical element reinforced these eternal verities through endless repetition of slogans, choruses, and symbols. These techniques made fascism a new religion with rites long familiar from traditional religious observance. Fascist mass meetings seemed novel but contained predominantly traditional elements in both technique and ideology. The cult of the leader, the choreographed rallies, the sacred symbols - all served to contain potentially chaotic activism within the framework of reverence for nation, Volk, and tradition.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Fascism Analysis Essays", "author": "AV Dremel", "work": "Fascism Analysis Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Av_Dremel_Fascism#010", "instruction": "What distinguished fascism from reactionary conservatism?", "response": "Mosse sharply distinguishes fascism from reactionary regimes despite some surface similarities. Reaction rejected all revolution, opting for the status quo and looking back to the ancien r\u00e9gime. It stressed traditional hierarchy of entrenched privilege, which naturally discouraged activism and mass movements. Reactionaries thought in strictly territorial terms - the 'shared soul' of all nationals or Volk would have had little meaning for them. Most importantly, reactionary regimes were not interested in bringing the disenfranchised into politics or ending alienation; their efforts kept men away from politics to maintain the ruling class monopoly. Culture was unimportant; reactionary regimes gave wide latitude to artistic expression so long as it didn't encroach on political power. Horthy's Hungary exemplified this: he wouldn't allow opposition to challenge his will, but didn't think it government's duty to regiment subjects' conduct or thoughts. French fascists split from Action Fran\u00e7aise because it wasn't revolutionary enough. Franco destroyed Spain's fascist Falange in favor of Horthy-like dictatorship.

Both attempted to recapture the 'whole man' who seemed atomized and alienated by society. Both looked inward - toward instinct or the soul - rather than outward to positivist, pragmatic solutions that bourgeois society prized. There is 'nothing surprising,' Mosse notes, that fascism felt an affinity with expressionist art and literature, and that even a 'not wholly unimportant segment of national-socialism' tried to embrace them. This connection illuminates fascism's cultural dimension: it was not merely a political movement but a response to the same crisis of modernity that produced avant-garde art movements.

Mass terror cannot be part of the definition of fascism as a European-wide movement. There is a crucial difference between fascist violence and street fighting on one hand, and mass terror on the other. Mass terror was explained partly by the predominance of racial and anti-Jewish direction in central and eastern Europe, where a concrete human enemy could be identified. Additionally, mass terror was restrained by factors like identifying the nation with the existing state. In Italy, Mussolini never tried to depose the monarchy; English, Belgian, and Dutch fascism proclaimed loyalty to state symbols. Where fascisms sought to liquidate all existing political institutions for the sake of Volk (as in Germany), activism could have greater play.

This new man was 'made whole once more' - aware of his archetype and those with whom he shared it, an activist unafraid to join a revolution that would make society correspond to his soul's longings. These longings were for unity with the group, for recapturing virtues being submerged in the modern world. As Hitler stated, a man rooted in the worldview to which he belonged was not afraid to make it come true. Once joined, he released creative instincts and power of will in common cause. Triumph meant the whole nation would share this creativity and renew itself. Economic well-being was subordinate to stress upon art, literature, and the total cultural endeavor.
