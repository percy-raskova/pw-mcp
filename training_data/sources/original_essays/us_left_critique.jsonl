The tailst organization observes which direction masses are moving and rushes to position itself at the rear, claiming to lead while actually following. Manifestations include: uncritically endorsing whatever demands emerge spontaneously without developing revolutionary analysis; adopting liberal framings to appear 'relevant'; subordinating revolutionary politics to electoral campaigns of bourgeois parties; pursuing 'coalition' work that consists of providing organizational labor for non-revolutionary forces; avoiding positions that might alienate potential members regardless of political correctness. The tailst fears being 'too radical' and losing popularity. But a revolutionary party must be the vanguard - the advanced detachment providing theoretical clarity and strategic direction. As Lenin argued, the party brings socialist consciousness to the working class from without; it doesn't simply reflect whatever ideas workers currently hold. Tailism ensures organizational growth produces nothing revolutionary - merely another liberal NGO with red aesthetics.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "US Left Critique", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "US Left Critique"}, "classification": {"categories": ["original-essays", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Us_Left_Critique#002", "instruction": "What does revolutionary audience selection mean?", "response": "Sure, you need to tailor your rhetoric to your audience, but you also CHOOSE your audience. The audience for anything revolutionary should be those who hear 'America is fascist' and instead of punching you in the face, go 'Wait... what do you mean by that?' - or they go 'Yup!' The 'don't say fascist, that's too divisive!' crowd say that because they are fundamentally uninterested in cultivating that audience. They believe that THEY and THEIR social cohort are the revolutionary subject that must be begged to participate in revolution. They're wrong. Revolution does not need their consent, or the consent of every social fraction - only the ones whose very existence is constantly at risk by the fascist regime under which we live. Ignore (or pretend to ignore) its nature, and you will never defeat it. Liberal organizations like DSA can't bear to even associate with anything that has a whiff of militancy, or maintain liberal compatibility. 'Let's learn about gun safety!' is too far, because there's no context in which liberals could conceive of guns entering the equation - not as community defense against fascist violence, and certainly not as means of liberation. When 'We have our tax-exempt status to worry about!' is the victorious argument in 2025 with Nazis in the streets, the dominant tendency being 'Ewwww, guns??? But that's what RADICALS use' tells you everything about what's possible within such organizations.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "US Left Critique", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "US Left Critique"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "original-essays", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Us_Left_Critique#003", "instruction": "How does a general strike actually happen?", "response": "You guys want a general strike? Good. But it's not happening this weekend just because some people tweet about it and put up polls about when we should 'just do it.' There are two ways a general strike can actually happen. The first relies on union leadership explicitly calling for a general strike and members following through. This would be the product of many years of organizing. Current national union leadership is opposed to radical change - they are where they are because of commitment to advancing their own power, which includes consorting with other people in power, not challenging them. Second, union density is low due to decades of deliberate legislative efforts and union-busting PR. A top-down general strike is years or decades of organizing, legislative efforts, and leadership-ousting away. The second way is organically, starting at ground level - essentially a wave of local strikes sweeping the nation, which can later be recognized as a general strike. This requires more luck. You can't plan this chain of events without a national network of organizers that doesn't currently exist in needed capacity. But luck aside, this path is more feasible short-term. The path forward for individuals: organize your workplace, stay in contact with other local workers, particularly unions with active membership. If people make this effort all across the country, conditions may be just right in a couple locales for a city-wide general strike. With strong media effort by organizers there, it can become regional or national news. This attention makes it easier for organizers in other regions to point to a strike as plausible. Over weeks or months, you might - MIGHT - see a national movement like we saw with the George Floyd protests. The bandwagon effect is our only hope. So what is your next step? 1) Form or join a union. 2) Reach out to other local unions. 3) Feel out local DSA chapters if they're able to help organize workplaces.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "US Left Critique", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "US Left Critique"}, "classification": {"categories": ["original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Us_Left_Critique#004", "instruction": "What is imperial chauvinism and why is it the biggest barrier to revolution in North America?", "response": "Imperial chauvinism - the settler working class's instinctive identification with the imperial system that oppresses them - is the primary barrier to communist revolution in North America. Not opportunism, not reformism, though these flow from it. The seeming unshakeable allegiance to a globe-spanning imperialist system imbues even exploited workers with material interest in preserving that order. The contradiction isn't theoretically difficult: all workers are oppressed under capitalism; some more heavily than others. The entire working class would benefit from capitalism's overthrow. But bridging the gap between 'working class liberation' and 'complete liquidation of the US empire' is ideologically harder than any other revolutionary task we face. Getting people to understand that revolution means eradicating the US in its entirety - not reforming it, not making it better, but ending it as a political entity - is the fundamental challenge. Even those who earnestly believe they're striving for liberation often fail to internalize what that means. Their thoughts remain suffused with intractable liberalism stemming from empire-fed material instinct. This is why every major 'socialist' or 'communist' organization in North America remains legally tolerated by the state: their vision of 'liberation' leaves imperial and colonial systems largely intact. No state tolerates the engine of its own destruction.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "US Left Critique", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "US Left Critique"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "imperialism", "original-essays", "revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

You don't have courage to say 'I am religious, so it offends ME to suggest communism is atheistic.' Instead you act like this is the one tendency The Masses would never abandon. Presumably, you don't use this reasoning for other tendencies - the various chauvinisms, individualisms, and idealisms found throughout working classes. Unless you yourself are transphobic, you don't claim trans liberation is anti-working class. 'This is what my perception of the working class believes' is not reason for us to adopt any attitude. You must know this. The working class by and large believes revolution is impossible, that communism is 'just as bad or worse.' They believe incorrect things. Tailism is the graveyard of revolution, and most of you understand that. So why reach for it when it comes to YOUR beliefs? Just say 'I am religious. Please leave me alone, I don't want this belief challenged.' Being religious isn't the same as being a chauvinist. It's not something we need to brutally expunge from our movement.

{"qa_id": "Essays/Us_Left_Critique#006", "instruction": "How do revolutionaries determine who are allies?", "response": "Who are our allies? The ones who are willing to come to US and work with us, no matter our principles. We set our feet and make it clear we won't buckle on those principles - no chauvinism, no reformism, no collaboration with the state, etc. Any prospective allies filter themselves based on their willingness to accept that. Chauvinists won't work with us if we make it clear opposing chauvinism is crucial. Same with reformists. With anarchists that AREN'T turned away by our principles, working with them is valuable. Obviously there are still necessary checks after that in terms of how we deal with allies. But the primary check of 'Here is what we unshakably stand for, call us if you're ok with that' is how we avoid watering down our mission for the sake of facile 'unity.' And it ensures any coalition we are part of actually serves that mission, with all members being serious about their involvement.

{"qa_id": "Essays/Us_Left_Critique#008", "instruction": "What are the two fundamental methods of Communist leadership according to Mao?", "response": "In 'Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership' (1943), Mao identified two methods Communists must employ in all work: (1) Combine the general with the particular - issue general calls to mobilize masses, but also go deeply into specific units, gain concrete experience, and use that experience to enrich and test general directives; (2) Combine leadership with the masses - leadership must be connected to mass activity, not operate in isolation. These methods are interconnected: general calls without particular guidance produce nothing ('there is the danger that nothing may come of it'), while particular work without general direction lacks coordination. Mao emphasized that 'no one in a leading position is competent to give general guidance to all the units unless he derives concrete experience from particular individuals and events in particular subordinate units.' Leaders must simultaneously learn and lead - the method is itself 'the way by which the leaders combine leading and learning.' This counters both commandism (issuing orders from above without connection to reality) and tailism (following masses without providing direction).", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "US Left Critique", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "US Left Critique"}, "classification": {"categories": ["original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
