But it's more useful to view it like a chronic condition, in the same vein as AIDS coming out of HIV infection, or MS coming from Epstein-Barr virus. It's a multi-system affliction, not just a respiratory infection. Cardiovascular, neurological, and - crucially - immune damage are the real 'goal' of SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory system is just its route into the body. It sets up shop all over your body and evades immune detection. The effects of ignoring this 'invisible' stage of chronic disease progression will continue to accumulate in society. It will be more insidious than even AIDS, due to its respiratory route. Even if the acute stage gets less deadly, more deaths and disability will rack up. Many clinicians - and definitely all public officials - will fail to attribute ever-increasing rates of death and disability to the pandemic of yesteryear. It'll be chalked up to 'unknown etiology.' Scientists will expose real causes for decades, constantly ignored. This mass chronic illness will be the backdrop of coming climate change upheaval. Ascendant global fascism will harden further in face of mass migrations from disaster-ravaged regions. It's not 'lack of discipline' that precludes 'self-improvement' - if you got COVID and now experience chronic fatigue, your biochemistry has been altered. Your muscles literally break down in response to exertion. The problem isn't that you're not working hard enough.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "COVID Essays", "author": "AV Dremel", "work": "COVID Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

Where HIV makes a permanent home in immune cells, SARS2 makes something like a temporary barricade\u2014locks itself in, pumps out offspring, then eventually gets destroyed. But SARS2 is very good at keeping those bases going with a terror campaign. It forces cells to flood the area with warning signals, driving counter-insurgency forces crazy.

They could not have 'forgotten' established concepts like viral evolution dynamics, airborne transmission mechanics, or immune dysregulation implications. They are not ignorant. The questions they refused to ask were asked, answered, and answered again. Study after study has dug the grave of all their false optimism.

{"qa_id": "Essays/Av_Dremel_Covid#007", "instruction": "How does ORF8 make SARS-CoV-2 particularly dangerous?", "response": "ORF8 is a SARS-CoV-2 gene associated with severity in both acute and persistent phases. ORF8 mutants don't cause as much harm. Researchers demonstrated that ORF8 encodes a protein that mimics histones\u2014the proteins that package DNA and regulate which genes are expressed. Your cells use histones to regulate gene expression; if DNA is tightly packed with histones, your cell generally can't express those genes. SARS-CoV-2's ORF8 protein mimics histones, meaning on a molecular level, it affects gene expression in its hosts. We already knew the virus affected gene expression without knowing how.

Transmissibility: You can't transmit Lyme disease or horse riding injury to someone else by breathing on them. Novelty and magnitude: Long COVID can affect every organ system, lasts as long as we've tracked it, has symptoms ranging from mild cough to unable to get out of bed. We don't know risk factors, disease progression, or damage extent with each infection. Clues point to very serious chronic condition with accumulating severity.

Just as omicron was as distinct from SARS-CoV-2 as SARS-CoV-2 was from SARS, Pirola (BA.2.86) is again as distinct from omicron as omicron was from the original strain. JN.1, descended from Pirola, balanced distinctiveness with transmissibility. Unless you've already been infected with it, your immune system is essentially completely naive to it. It's more transmissible than its parent and driving the largest increase in cases and hospitalizations since omicron itself. There have only been 3 true 'waves' of COVID: initial emergence, omicron's rise, and JN.1.

Normally preventing replication would end infection, but SARS-CoV-2 is special\u2014it can lay in wait then resume activities. After normal treatment course, the drug degrades and virus can resurge. This is why Biden tested positive again soon after testing negative. The virus evades immune detection by suppressing the 'Hey, there's a virus in here!' MHC pathway\u2014which is also why vaccines aren't very good at preventing transmission. Once the virus sets up shop, it can stay undetected and spread at leisure.
