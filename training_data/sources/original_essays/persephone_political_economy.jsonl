Developers bought up plots, left much of the plot undeveloped, and built ultra-tall skyscrapers to ensure good views. And the ultra-rich who buy units don't even live in them. These properties, held by global billionaires as speculative wealth and tax shelters, have not 'freed up market space' for lower-income housing. The exact opposite has occurred. Real estate prices have risen in direct response to this deliberate scam. Market forces do not EVER push for greater accessibility. The physics of market pricing work exclusively on one principle: maximize profit. In real estate, there is perceived profit in hoarding but not using. Investing millions in luxury apartments is portrayed as the most stable way to increase wealth long-term - the property will always be there and eventually spike for massive gains. So they buy and hold. At the top of this hoarding, the investment is also used for money laundering, tax evasion, and capital flight. Billions of dollars-worth of fake value, completely disengaged from even the 'legitimate' housing market. That is the core problem with YIMBYism. The honest actors imagine that since developers are trying to make profit, they must surely do The Thing that you do to make profit - offer your product to the public and find optimal exchange price. But the profit isn't coming from free exchange. Quite the opposite: the demand from the ultra-rich comes directly from the very nature of inaccessibility. The same is true at smaller scale across the world. Over decades, developers and investment firms have realigned 'housing' into a giant shell game with no tether to the fundamental human need for shelter. Communists understand this. We don't disagree with 'build affordable housing.' We scoff at the naivety of thinking an entity with capital to build would willingly sacrifice the windfall of scam real estate for pennies on the dollar of affordable housing.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Political Economy Essays", "author": "Persephone Raskova", "work": "Political Economy Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Persephone_Political_Economy#002", "instruction": "Why is '80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck' misleading?", "response": "'80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck' is hilarious, considering that 50% of US households have a net worth of $200,000, and they self-report being 'paycheck to paycheck' by including various forms of paying THEMSELVES (retirement funds, mortgages, etc.). 'Paycheck to paycheck' conjures images of precarity - 'If I miss my next paycheck, I am ruined.' If you own $200,000 more than you owe, you are quite simply not even close to that situation. When these people say 'paycheck to paycheck,' they don't mean they'll be on the streets. They mean they might have to liquidate assets. They might have to hit pause on the wealth generation machine that 90% of the world can't even access. Most of them have enough in liquid assets to pay bills for three months. This formulation of 'the government is giving so much money away to other countries instead of helping poor starving Americans' is an attempt to present Americans - the richest population on the planet - as the primary victim of American imperialism. $3.8 billion a year is 0.0025% of the ~$155 trillion owned by the top 65%. People are being slaughtered by the thousands, and your concern is that the government owes you $11. And you wonder why actual communists despise you.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "Political Economy Essays", "author": "Persephone Raskova", "work": "Political Economy Essays"}, "classification": {"categories": ["imperialism", "original-essays"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
