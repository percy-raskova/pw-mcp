The pattern involves: clubs or chapters forbidden from communicating directly with each other - all communication mediated by leadership; multiple approval layers ensuring every activity conforms to leadership preferences; membership excluded from strategic discussions and financial information; criticism of leadership punished rather than welcomed.

The organization becomes a fief where leadership rules absolutely rather than a democratic expression of collective revolutionary will. Members become passive dues-payers rather than active participants in revolutionary politics. Without democracy, centralism degenerates into personal rule.

It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. They used intimidation tactics to secure resources. They organized boycotts of local businesses that refused to contribute. They housed the program in churches so that when the violent arm of the state came to bust them up (which they inevitably did), they could show the masses, 'See? Nothing is sacred to these pigs.' They enforced strict discipline in volunteers - no tardiness, no stealing. The nationwide program wasn't just disparate groups imitating each other: it was a centrally-planned rollout with specific protocols and democratic centralism as the core framework. Each program was tailored to local need but implemented in concert with the national. It wasn't simply charity either. It formed the backbone of a mass line. Parents and children alike were educated on black liberation and Marxism-Leninism. The party learned from the people about specific community needs while teaching them about revolution in general. State oppression kept ramping up not because they were simply feeding the people, but because of HOW they were doing it. The Black Panthers came the closest we've ever had in this country to building dual power. And of course they had to bend the rules to do it. They carried guns, made credible threats, organized the masses for collective action, and never compromised on their values. The state only defeated them because they didn't achieve critical mass.

People who need to be the most radical person in the room, who would rather split an organization than not lead it, who treat every disagreement as a betrayal. This isn't about having strong convictions - revolutionary movements require people with strong convictions. It's about the inability to subordinate ego to collective purpose. The narcissist can't distinguish between 'this organization should do X' and 'this organization should recognize my brilliance by doing X.' When the organization doesn't do X, they experience it as personal rejection rather than political disagreement. Democratic centralism is precisely designed to handle political disagreement: debate fully, decide collectively, implement unified. But it requires participants who can lose a vote and still commit to the decision. Narcissists can't do this because their identity is wrapped up in being right. Revolutionary discipline means accepting that you might be wrong, that the collective might see something you don't, that your role is to contribute to a process larger than yourself.

The difference is whether the centralism emerges from genuine democratic process or substitutes for it. In democratic centralism, members debate freely and fully before decisions, the majority decision binds everyone including dissenters, and implementation is unified. The centralism serves the democracy: it ensures that what people decided actually happens. In bureaucratic centralism, leadership makes decisions and presents them as organizational line, 'debate' is performative or constrained, and discipline is used to suppress rather than implement democratic will. The centralism replaces democracy. Many organizations that call themselves democratic centralist are actually bureaucratic centralist - they've adopted the form without the substance. You can tell the difference by asking: can ordinary members actually change organizational direction through internal process? Or does the same leadership clique always prevail regardless of what members think? Real democratic centralism is hard. It requires building genuine democratic culture, accepting that leadership will sometimes lose votes, maintaining discipline even when you disagree with decisions.

Democratic centralism concentrates decision-making power to serve the working class; opportunist tyranny concentrates power to serve a clique. The forms may look similar - both involve organizational discipline, unified action, and leadership with real authority. The content is entirely different. How do you tell them apart? Look at the relationship between leaders and members. In genuine democratic centralism, leaders are accountable to the membership through regular elections, transparent processes, and the ability of members to actually recall or overrule leadership. Leaders who abuse authority can be removed. In opportunist organizations, 'democratic' processes are captured - elections are managed, dissent is pathologized, and the same leaders persist regardless of member sentiment. Look also at whose interests decisions serve. Do organizational positions consistently benefit the working class, even when that's difficult for the organization? Or do positions consistently serve organizational preservation, leadership prestige, or factional interests?

The party practices democratic centralism: full debate before decisions, iron unity after. This is not contradiction but synthesis - democracy gives the party access to the knowledge and creativity of all members; centralism allows decisive action. Organizations without centralism cannot act; organizations without democracy become bureaucratic cliques serving their own interests. The party is not the whole movement but its leading core.

It is not liberal 'processing' or therapeutic confession but a rigorous political practice. When errors occur - and they will - the organization must analyze them openly: what was the mistake, what were its causes, what are its consequences, how do we prevent recurrence? This applies to individuals and to the organization as a whole. Self-criticism demonstrates that the revolutionary takes responsibility for their actions and is committed to improvement. It is not groveling but honest assessment. Criticism of comrades is not personal attack but political intervention - we criticize because we want comrades to develop, because uncorrected errors harm the movement. Criticism must be principled: address specific actions and their political content, not personality or character. It must be comradely: aimed at correction and development, not punishment. And it must be honest: we do not spare criticism to preserve feelings, nor do we pile on to settle scores. Organizations that cannot practice criticism and self-criticism cannot learn from experience. They repeat errors, protect incompetent or unprincipled leadership, and stagnate. Organizations that weaponize criticism - using it for factional warfare or personal vendettas - destroy trust and cohesion.

However, Gonzalo's error lay in elevating his own particular application ('Gonzalo Thought') to quasi-universal status, demanding it be accepted as 'principal' for the Peruvian revolution. This conflated the correct principle that theory must be applied concretely with a cult of personality that substituted one person's judgments for collective analysis and mass line.

First, substituting party for class: despite rhetoric about 'people's war,' Sendero increasingly acted as a force imposing its will ON peasants rather than mobilizing WITH them. The peasant 'rondas' (self-defense patrols) that ultimately helped defeat Sendero emerged partly because communities sought protection FROM the guerrillas, not just the state. Second, confusing terror with revolutionary violence: actions like the 1983 Lucanamarca massacre (which Gonzalo openly acknowledged as 'excesses' while defending as necessary) violated the mass line principle that revolutionaries must win hearts, not just impose discipline. Mao's dictum that guerrillas should move among the people 'as fish swim in the sea' requires the sea to welcome the fish. Third, cult of personality: elevating 'Gonzalo Thought' to guiding doctrine insulated leadership from correction.

This method - going to the countryside, convening peasants, listening systematically - embodied what would become the 'investigation and research' principle. Mao immediately states his conclusion: 'Many of the hows and whys of the peasant movement were the exact opposite of what the gentry in Hankow and Changsha are saying.' The report was written to answer critics within the Party (Right opportunists led by Chen Tu-hsiu who 'would not accept his views'). The document demonstrates that correct political line comes from investigation of actual conditions, not from preconceived theories or ruling-class narratives about what the masses are doing.

Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms.' This liberalism substitutes personal loyalty for political principle. The comrade who won't criticize a friend's errors, the cadre who goes easy on someone from their hometown, the partner who avoids political disagreement to preserve domestic harmony - all exemplify this tendency. The result: 'both the organization and the individual are harmed.' The individual continues in error uncorrected; the organization loses the capacity for self-rectification.

The cadre who witnesses exploitation but doesn't intervene; the member who sees a comrade mistreating workers but minds their own business; the communist who observes injustice but calculates that challenging it isn't their responsibility - all practice this passive complicity. Notice Mao's sequence: first 'feel indignant' - the emotional response to injustice is itself important. Then act: 'dissuade or stop him or reason with him.' The specific method depends on circumstances, but doing nothing is unacceptable. This connects to the mass line: communists must genuinely care about the masses, not abstractly but concretely - being moved by their suffering, defending their interests, fighting those who harm them.

The cadre who does the minimum required; the member who shows up but isn't really present; the organizer who follows routine without asking whether it's achieving anything - all embody this 'tolling the bell' mentality. The proverb Mao quotes captures the attitude perfectly: fulfilling the formal requirements of a role without its substance or spirit. Revolutionary work requires intention, planning, and direction - asking what we're trying to achieve, whether our methods are working, how we can do better. Perfunctory work produces perfunctory results. The person who muddles along has already accepted defeat; they're occupying a position without filling it.

This liberalism trades on past contributions to excuse present failures. The longtime member who considers themselves above basic tasks; the veteran cadre who stops studying because they think they already know enough; the revolutionary who coasts on reputation rather than continuing to develop - all manifest this degeneration. Past service, however genuine, creates no permanent credit. The revolution's needs change; yesterday's hero can become today's obstacle. 'Disdaining minor assignments' reveals misunderstanding of revolutionary work - there are no minor assignments, only necessary tasks that someone must do. 'Being quite unequal to major tasks' while claiming veteran status is particularly damaging: it blocks positions that could be filled by developing cadres while contributing nothing.

This liberalism applies different standards to self than to others. The comrade who can identify errors in others' work but excuses their own; the cadre who knows their weaknesses but treats them as unchangeable personality traits rather than problems to overcome; the communist who criticizes liberalism in others while practicing it themselves - all exemplify this self-indulgence. It connects to Mao's broader critique: liberals 'apply Marxism to others but liberalism to themselves. They keep both kinds of goods in stock and find a use for each.' Self-criticism is not merely admitting mistakes but committing to correct them. Awareness without action is worse than ignorance - it means you know what's right but choose not to do it.

(4) Build counter-hegemonic training data - AI systems reflect the data they're trained on, currently dominated by imperial-core English-language content encoding bourgeois perspectives. Creating high-quality revolutionary training corpora is ideological work for the AI age. (5) Develop critical AI literacy among masses - people need to understand both capabilities and limitations, neither fearing AI as magic nor trusting it uncritically.

Rather than relying on encrypted apps or burner phones, the primary security comes from how the organization is structured and what politics it practices. Two specific applications: 'Organize ourselves so our actions cannot be co-opted' - meaning the political line and organizational structure make it impossible for infiltrators to redirect the organization toward state interests or discredit it through provocations. 'Organize so that the only way a bad actor can progress in your org is by advancing the organization itself' - meaning advancement requires actual political work that serves revolutionary goals, not personal relationships or factional maneuvering. An infiltrator who must do genuine organizing to gain influence has limited ability to cause harm, and the organization benefits from their work regardless of their intentions. This contrasts with security theater that focuses on individual technical practices while leaving organizational vulnerabilities intact.

You don't put as much energy and emphasis on the redundancy and capacity to satisfy your ego.' When individuals seek visibility and recognition rather than building organizational capacity, leadership becomes concentrated in identifiable figures rather than distributed across cadre. This directly serves police strategy - they 'know who the leaders are' and can 'arrest or raid or just straight execute the leadership' in a single strike. 'Right deviationism and opportunism creates careers that people buy into' - individuals become invested in their personal position rather than organizational success, making them both easier to identify and potentially more vulnerable to compromise. The alternative is building redundancy - multiple people capable of any function, distributed decision-making, emphasis on developing cadre rather than elevating individuals.

A social network is a graph: nodes (individuals) connected by edges (relationships). Political police analyze this topology to identify high-value targets. Nodes with high 'betweenness centrality' - people who connect otherwise separate clusters - are priority targets because removing them fragments the network. Nodes with high 'degree centrality' - people with many connections - are visible leaders. 'Eigenvector centrality' identifies people connected to well-connected people, revealing hidden influencers. Understanding these metrics suggests defensive strategies. Avoid hub-and-spoke structures where one leader connects to everyone - removing the hub collapses the network. Prefer mesh topologies with redundant connections where no single node is critical. Build 'small world' networks: tight local clusters (cells) with sparse inter-cluster connections, limiting damage from any single compromise.

Classic cell structures: members know their cell, cell leaders know other cell leaders, but rank-and-file don't know each other across cells. If one cell is compromised, damage is contained. But compartmentalization creates coordination problems - how do separate cells act coherently without communication that creates vulnerability? The resolution lies in shared political line and strategic understanding. If all cells understand the organization's analysis and goals, they can act independently in ways that reinforce each other without explicit coordination. This is why political education isn't just ideological - it's operational security. A cadre who deeply understands the line can make correct decisions without consulting leadership, reducing communication that surveillance could intercept. Democratic centralism provides the framework: centralized strategic decisions communicated through secure channels, decentralized tactical execution by cadre who understand the strategy well enough to implement it independently.

A culture of discretion where people naturally avoid unnecessary disclosure is more effective than rules about secrecy that people resent and circumvent. A culture of political seriousness makes provocation attempts obvious because they contradict how serious cadre behave. A culture of collective responsibility means people don't pursue individual visibility that creates targeting opportunities. Culture is built through practice, modeling, and reinforcement. Leaders who practice discretion teach discretion. Organizations that handle internal conflicts through political struggle rather than personal attacks build cultures where COINTELPRO-style manipulation is obvious and ineffective. Regular political education builds the shared understanding that enables compartmentalized units to act coherently without excessive communication. The security implications: culture is a force multiplier for formal security measures or an underminer of them. Technically sophisticated security in a culturally undisciplined organization is brittle. Modest technical security in a disciplined culture is robust.

The error is applying cadre security standards to mass work or mass accessibility standards to cadre organization. Mass organizations should assume infiltration and structure accordingly: keep sensitive planning separate from mass meetings, don't collect unnecessary personal information, expect that what's said publicly will reach police. But don't let this prevent building mass organizations - the point is reaching masses, which requires openness. Cadre organizations can maintain higher security through selective recruitment, longer observation before trust, compartmentalization, and clearer accountability.
