{"qa_id": "Library/Iranian_Fedai#001", "instruction": "What was the Iranian Fedai theory of armed struggle as both strategy and tactic?", "response": "Massoud Ahmadzadeh, theorist of the Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas, argued that armed struggle is simultaneously strategic (the overall path to revolution) and tactical (the immediate method for mobilizing masses under dictatorship). The formula: Politico-military cells \u2192 Guerrilla focos \u2192 People's army \u2192 Seizure of power. Ahmadzadeh stated: 'To defeat Reaction, the reactionary army must be smashed. To smash the reactionary army, a people's army must exist. The only way to smash the reactionary army and to build the people's army is prolonged guerrilla struggle.' He emphasized political-military fusion: 'The political and military factors are fused together in an inevitable and organic way. On the one hand, the mobilization of the masses is the condition for the victory of armed struggle. Yet, on the other hand, mobilization of the masses is not possible without armed struggle.' Armed action IS political education under dictatorship - the most effective propaganda is successful military action against the 'invincible' enemy.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic", "author": "Iranian Fedai", "work": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Iranian_Fedai#002", "instruction": "How did the Iranian Fedai analyze the conditions requiring armed struggle?", "response": "The Fedai analysis identified Iran as under organic imperialist domination through a puppet regime. Ahmadzadeh argued: 'The problem of imperialist domination must be regarded not as an extraneous factor that plays some role, but rather organically as the basis for any analysis and elucidation.' Under conditions of unbridled dictatorship: constant repression, failures of past bourgeois leadership (National Front, Tudeh Party), regime propaganda spreading hopelessness, and crucially, 'abysmal distrust' between workers and intellectuals due to past betrayals. Ahmadzadeh posed the fundamental question: 'How can we crack the colossal barrier of suppressive power; a barrier separating the people from their intellectuals, separating the masses from themselves and separating the necessity of mass struggle from the existence of mass struggle itself?' Under violent dictatorship where 'revolutionary intellectuals are not even able to retain their own association through peaceful means,' armed struggle becomes the only viable path.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic", "author": "Iranian Fedai", "work": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic"}, "classification": {"categories": ["imperialism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Iranian_Fedai#003", "instruction": "What was Amir Parviz Pouyan's refutation of the 'theory of survival'?", "response": "Pouyan's pamphlet attacked those who argued 'Let us not take the offensive in order to survive.' He analyzed workers' conditions under SAVAK terror: workers 'presume the power of their enemy to be absolute and their own inability to emancipate themselves as absolute.' This creates a vicious circle - terror produces submission, submission reinforces avoidance of struggle. Pouyan's solution: 'The revolutionary power is used to deal with this matter. The application of this power, which in addition to its propaganda nature is accompanied by distinct political agitation on a large scale, makes the proletariat conscious of a source of power which belongs to it. First, it will find out that the enemy is vulnerable.' He exposed the 'survival theory' as opportunism: its formula of 'study + minimum organization + appropriate moment = Party + favorable conditions = revolution' serves to justify 'paralyzing fear of the enemy.' His devastating conclusion: 'Let us not take the offensive in order to survive reveals itself in practice as let us dismiss all revolutionary endeavors in order to survive.' The correct thesis: 'We must take the offensive in order to survive.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic", "author": "Iranian Fedai", "work": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Iranian_Fedai#004", "instruction": "What distinguished the Fedai approach from copying other revolutions?", "response": "Ahmadzadeh insisted on creative application of Marxism-Leninism to Iranian conditions: 'Since revolution in all societies occurs under a series of general laws, all past revolutionary experiences provide lessons which should be learned. But revolutionaries in any given country must find the path to revolution in their country by discovering the specificity of objective conditions of their society, and theorize it.' He explicitly rejected copying Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese, or Cuban models: 'Borrowed political theory cannot become the proper guideline for revolutionary action.' The Russian path of peaceful preparation leading to mass uprising was blocked by fascist repression - workers couldn't even form trade unions. The key insight: 'Under the present conditions, any political struggle must necessarily be organized on the basis of armed struggle. Only the armed small motor can set the big motor of the masses into motion. The genuine vanguard that has a profound bond with the masses can come into existence only through the course of armed action within the process of political-military work.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic", "author": "Iranian Fedai", "work": "Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
