In prison, he discovered Marx, Lenin, Mao, and Fanon, who 'redeemed' him: 'I met the black guerrillas... We attempted to transform the black criminal mentality into a black revolutionary mentality.' His commitment to revolution meant permanent denial of parole, over seven years in solitary confinement, and constant assassination attempts by prison authorities. He became dangerous to them through his organizing talent and his principle of always backing words with action. He wrote 'Blood in My Eye' just days before his murder at San Quentin on August 21, 1971.

Anything less is merely reform. He emphasized Lenin's point that the working class 'cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery' but must 'break up, smash' it entirely. Revolutionary change means 'the seizure of all that is held by the 1 percent, and the transference of these holdings into the hands of the remaining 99 percent.'

Without US military aid and 'Gestapo death squads,' these puppet regimes would fall to liberation armies.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["fascism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/George_Jackson#024", "instruction": "Why did George Jackson criticize Eldridge Cleaver?", "response": "Jackson criticized Cleaver for divisive behavior and ego-driven actions that endangered comrades. He noted Cleaver's pattern of attacking allies: 'his Muslims (through the Sacramento Bee Pig press), then against the Peace and Freedom Party, even against the progressive elements of the C.P. through his unreasoned attack on the magnificent Angela Davis. Recently he has even attacked the dedicated, overworked and brilliant Charles Garry.' Cleaver also attacked 'Fidel and Cuba' while in exile there. Most critically, Cleaver's analysis that 'no separation should exist even now between military and political cadre' was strategically wrong - it would expose political leadership to persecution under conspiracy laws. Jackson sent Cleaver a letter noting 'his behavior while in prison was far from exemplary' and asking him to 'show proof now that he was not a compulsive disrupter or agent provocateur.' Cleaver responded with 'scurrilous and profane invectives.' Jackson concluded there was 'no split in the party, only a defection. The party has come out of it stronger.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/George_Jackson#025", "instruction": "What did Huey Newton say about George Jackson's legacy?", "response": "In his eulogy, Newton called Jackson 'my hero' who 'set a standard for prisoners, political prisoners, for people. He showed the love, the strength, the revolutionary fervor that's characteristic of any soldier for the people.' Newton emphasized that 'although George's body has fallen, his spirit goes on, because his ideas live. And we will see that these ideas stay alive, because they'll be manifested in our bodies and in these young Panthers' bodies, who are our children.' He directly challenged state violence: 'The state itself sets the stage for the kind of contradiction or violence... The ruling circle of the United States has terrorized the world. The state has the audacity to say they have the right to kill... But I say by the laws of nature that no death penalty can be legal - it's only cold-blooded murder.' Newton declared: 'We will raise our children to be like George Jackson, to live like George Jackson and to fight for freedom as George Jackson fought for freedom.' Jackson's death was 'significant' while his enemies' deaths 'will be lighter than a feather.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/George_Jackson#026", "instruction": "What is the psychological basis of fascism according to George Jackson?", "response": "Jackson drew on Wilhelm Reich's analysis, quoting from The Mass Psychology of Fascism: 'Mankind is biologically sick. Politics is the irrational expression of this sickness.' Reich argued that 'this character structure is formed by socio-economic processes, and it anchors and perpetuates these processes. Man's biopathic character structure is, as it were, the fossilization of the authoritarian process of history.' The human structure 'is animated by the contradiction between an intense longing for and fear of freedom. The fear of freedom of masses of people is expressed in the biophysical rigidity of the organism and the inflexibility of the character.' Jackson applied this to understand how the ruling class builds 'contra-positive mobilization' - redirecting working-class anger away from the ruling class and toward scapegoats. Racism functions this way: workers feel 'insecure, lonely' under capitalism, and this 'sense of vulnerability is the breeding ground of racism' while providing 'a pressure release for psychopathic destructiveness.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "fascism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/George_Jackson#027", "instruction": "How does George Jackson describe the task of revolutionary consciousness?", "response": "Jackson argued that 'our overall task is to separate the people from the hated state. They must be made to realize that the interests of the state and the ruling class are one and the same. They must be taught to realize that the present political regime exists only to balance the productive forces within the society in favor of the ruling class.' The vanguard must aim at 'the ruling class and the governing elites, including those of labor' - corrupt union leaders who serve capital. Jackson predicted 'the average workingman will simply withdraw or watch with secret satisfaction or actively join in when we bring his union boss under attack.' Against a system 'programmed against our old methods,' revolutionaries must 'unite and revolutionize the black central-city commune, and slowly provide the people with the incentive to fight by allowing them to create programs that will meet all of their social, political and economic needs.' The answer is 'freedom' - defined as 'warmth and protection... food, not garbage... truth, harmony... the best medical attention... employment that is reasonable.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/George_Jackson#028", "instruction": "What did George Jackson learn from German fascism's failure?", "response": "Jackson analyzed how 'the German economy was already in ruins by the time the Reich expanded into Russia. This expansion itself was a symptom of the economy's death-directed lack of discipline. Its own internal contradictions and deceits destroyed it.' He emphasized that 'an industrial-military-based economy must expand to live, must forcibly balance trade in its favor to survive.' Germany attempted to 'rearm, deflate its currency, and at the same time continue to meet the war-swollen demands of heavy industry. It finally fell of its own weight.' The key lesson: 'only organized violence and armed struggle could have stopped them before they lost their minds and destroyed so many lives. The counter-terrorism of the socialist parties' vanguard and the proper direction of the people's consciousness could have changed the whole course of history.' German workers had 'better developed class consciousness than in any other European nation' - proving 'consciousness alone is obviously not the factor that determines which way a disintegrating society will develop - fascist or socialist.' Organized revolutionary action was required.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "fascism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/George_Jackson#029", "instruction": "What is freedom according to George Jackson?", "response": "At the conclusion of Blood in My Eye, Jackson defined freedom in concrete material terms: 'Freedom means warmth and protection against harsh exposure to the elements. It means food, not garbage. It means truth, harmony, and the social relations that spring from these. It means the best medical attention whenever it's needed. It means employment that is reasonable, that coincides with the individual necessities and feelings.' This wasn't abstract or merely political freedom but the fulfillment of human needs. Jackson declared: 'We will have this freedom even at the cost of total war.' Earlier he wrote that revolution 'builds in stages' toward this goal. True freedom requires destroying the oppressive contract entirely - 'the seizure of all that is held by the 1 percent, and the transference of these holdings into the hands of the remaining 99 percent.' Nothing less than total transformation of property relations would achieve genuine freedom for the oppressed.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Blood in My Eye", "author": "George Jackson", "work": "Blood in My Eye"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
