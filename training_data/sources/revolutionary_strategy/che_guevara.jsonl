However, this relationship is dynamic: 'During the progress of hostilities, guerrillas gradually develop into orthodox forces that operate in conjunction with other units of the regular army.' He identified three types of cooperation: strategic (harassing enemy rear, disrupting supply lines), tactical (destroying railways, establishing bases), and battle cooperation (acting as outposts, gathering intelligence). Using a vivid metaphor, Mao wrote: 'While these units function as guerrillas, they may be compared to innumerable gnats, which, by biting a giant both in front and in rear, ultimately exhaust him.' The key insight is transformation: guerrilla warfare represents a stage that develops into mobile and conventional warfare as revolutionary forces grow.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Guerrilla Warfare", "author": "Che Guevara", "work": "Guerrilla Warfare"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

He articulated seven fundamental political steps: arousing and organizing the people, achieving internal political unification, establishing bases, equipping forces, recovering national strength, destroying enemy's national strength, and regaining lost territories. Political work operates on three dimensions: applied to troops (spiritual unification of officers and men), applied to people (spiritual unification of army and people), and applied to enemy (destruction of enemy unity through propaganda and humane treatment of prisoners).

{"qa_id": "Library/Che_Guevara#003", "instruction": "What were Che Guevara's three fundamental lessons from the Cuban Revolution?", "response": "Che Guevara identified three decisive contributions from the Cuban experience to revolutionary movements: First, 'Popular forces can win a war against the army' - demonstrating that a dedicated guerrilla force backed by popular support can defeat a conventional military. Second, 'It is not necessary to wait until all conditions for making revolution exist; the insurrection can create them' - rejecting mechanical determinism and asserting that revolutionary action itself transforms objective conditions. Third, 'In underdeveloped America the countryside is the basic area for armed fighting' - locating the revolutionary center in rural areas where peasant grievances and favorable terrain combine. Che emphasized that the guerrilla fighter is fundamentally 'a social reformer' who 'takes up arms responding to the angry protest of the people against their oppressors, and fights in order to change the social system that keeps all his unarmed brothers in ignominy and misery.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Guerrilla Warfare", "author": "Che Guevara", "work": "Guerrilla Warfare"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

Che outlined three phases: First, the survival phase where a small band establishes itself, builds popular support, and conducts limited operations. Second, the expansion phase where guerrilla forces grow in numbers and capability, able to engage larger enemy units. Third, transformation into conventional warfare where the revolutionary army can conduct full-scale military operations. Che emphasized: 'After our regrouping and the first clashes accompanied by the repressive actions of the Batista army... Little by little, as the peasants came to recognize the invincibility of the guerrillas and the long duration of the struggle, they began responding more logically, joining our army as fighters.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Che_Guevara#005", "instruction": "How did Che Guevara analyze the role of terrain in guerrilla warfare?", "response": "Che distinguished between favorable and unfavorable terrain. Favorable terrain is 'wild country, few roads, mountains, jungles' where guerrillas can operate with advantage against superior conventional forces. The countryside provides cover, limits enemy mobility, and brings guerrillas close to the peasant base. In favorable terrain, 'the guerrilla band is an armed nucleus, the fighting vanguard of the people' directly integrated with agrarian struggle. Unfavorable terrain (urban areas, plains) requires different tactics: smaller units, greater emphasis on secrecy, suburban warfare as support for rural struggle. Che was clear about strategic priority: 'In underdeveloped America the countryside is the basic area for armed fighting.' Urban operations play a supporting role - sabotage, supply, intelligence - but cannot substitute for rural armed struggle. The exception is heavily industrialized countries where different conditions apply.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Guerrilla Warfare", "author": "Che Guevara", "work": "Guerrilla Warfare"}, "classification": {"categories": ["revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

Women served as combatants, demonstrating equal capacity for armed resistance. Beyond combat, women excelled in roles requiring courage under danger: as couriers carrying messages and supplies through enemy lines, where 'apparent frailty' could be an advantage. Women organized civilian support networks, worked in production (food, clothing, medical supplies), and maintained communications. Che emphasized that revolutionary struggle must advance women's liberation alongside national liberation - the two are inseparable. The Cuban Revolution demonstrated that women could perform all functions required by guerrilla warfare when given the opportunity.

The mountain band of 9 guerrillas attacked to rescue a captured comrade, killing the deputy commander and confiscating weapons. For 19 days they fought, destroying over 60 enemy troops before being overwhelmed by massive military response including the Shah's personal intervention. Tactical errors included: delay allowing police to strike first, absence of counter-intelligence, lack of coordination, and fatally, 'lack of firmness' - guerrillas refused to use force against villagers who didn't understand their purpose. Strategic error: abandoning 'permanent mobility' principle for fixed-position operations. Ashraf's key lesson: 'In early steps of guerrilla warfare, villagers cannot grasp the purpose of a small guerrilla band. The guerrilla's firmness and vigor, instead of tenderness and moderation, guarantees survival. In early steps, moderation is a weakness. The guerrilla must prove his existence with full power.'

All these people contribute to the economic greatness of the United States, which exploits them in some way. The same happens in Africa and Asia as well. Marxism breaks all that.'

Where the reactionary classes try to maintain power by any means, a spark will arise independently of anyone's will or desire that will ignite all of America or part of America, and ultimately, the people will come to power.'

If all of Latin America were freed from imperialist domination, imperialism itself would face serious problems.' He elaborated: 'The foundation of imperialism... is the domination of Latin American countries through unequal exchange, the exchange of manufactured goods for raw materials, and the taking of all decisive factors in each government through oligarchies sold out to imperialism... if all that changed, imperialism would lose its power.'

So there is a bit of a shift from quantity to quality: where one efficient person can do a job, 10 people are needed to discuss, exchange ideas, doubt, and even make mistakes to do the same job.' He diagnosed its roots: 'a certain lack of internal drive from some officials... a certain fear of the consequences of acts that necessitate protecting the paperwork... always a paper in front.'

When we say that the enemy's large-scale strategic offensive and our strategic retreat have in a sense largely come to an end, we do not altogether exclude the possibility of further offensives and retreats.'
