This manifests in statements like 'while it's true that resistance forces have killed civilians...' - rhetorical structures that imply both sides bear comparable responsibility. This fundamentally misunderstands the nature of colonial violence. In settler-colonial contexts, the category 'civilian' becomes problematic: settlers are active participants in dispossession whether or not they wear uniforms; colonial states deputize settlers as armed militias while maintaining 'civilian' classification. Resistance violence responds to ongoing structural violence of colonization itself. The framing serves liberal sensibilities by suggesting colonized peoples should resist 'responsibly' - accepting their own elimination rather than fighting back effectively. Revolutionary analysis recognizes that colonial violence is primary and resistance violence derivative; the asymmetry is fundamental, not incidental.

Even among Black Americans with the lowest rate, it's nearly 50%. How can 70% of an 'exploited proletariat' own such valuable assets? Home ownership is engineered by the bourgeois state to pacify masses and combat communism. As fascist Spain's housing minister stated: 'We want a nation of homeowners, not proletarians.' Beyond psychological pacification, home ownership represents wealth transfer from colonized to settlers. Settler colonialism is fundamentally about land ownership - eradicating Indigenous peoples through genocide and displacement so settlers can 'improve' and capitalize the land. In exchange for settling labor and Indigenous murder, settlers receive a slice of land. Though the western frontier is closed, the mortgage transforms housing from use-value into financialized commodity - the modern vector through which settler colonialism bestows spoils.

Both western US frontier and Zionist entity were founded on Indigenous corpses. The mature settler colony's veteran shock troops naturally aid their younger brothers across the Atlantic. This fraternal camaraderie between cowboys and Zionists reflects shared interest in maintaining global settler order. Similarly, labor aristocracy and bourgeoisie unite around divvying spoils of global south exploitation. This perverse solidarity is so powerful it becomes the principal aspect of labor exploitation's contradiction. While US bourgeoisie exploits US labor aristocracy, the labor aristocracy tolerates this because of material benefits from imperialism's unequal exchange.

The bourgeois nation requires territorial base and economic dominance. For diasporic peoples like Jews, who've historically existed across multiple nations with distinct cultures, languages, and economic positions, achieving bourgeois national status within capitalism requires becoming colonizers. That's what Zionism represents: an attempt by certain Jewish elites to construct a settler-colonial enterprise that claims to embody 'the Jewish nation.' But this erases the actual diversity of Jewish peoples - Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardic, and other Jewish communities with distinct histories and positions in various national contexts. The equation 'Zionism = the Jewish nation' is theoretically incoherent and politically dangerous. It erases actually existing Jewish national situations while making all Jews answerable for a settler-colonial state's crimes. As right-wing nationalism ascends globally, with its demands for rigid national hierarchies, Jews face existential threat precisely because Zionism has claimed to represent us while actually making us more vulnerable.

It frees the native from his inferiority complex and from his despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and restores his self-respect.' The practice of violence 'binds them together as a whole, since each individual forms a violent link in the great chain, a part of the great organism of violence which has surged upward in reaction to the settler's violence in the beginning.' Through armed struggle, 'the groups recognize each other and the future nation is already indivisible.' Even if armed struggle has been symbolic and decolonization rapid, 'the people have the time to see that the liberation has been the business of each and all and that the leader has no special merit.' They become 'jealous of the results of their action and take good care not to place their future, their destiny, or the fate of their country in the hands of a living god.'

It follows that it is closely involved in the liquidation of regionalism and of tribalism.' The national parties 'show no pity at all toward the caids and the customary chiefs. Their destruction is the preliminary to the unification of the people.' The armed struggle 'mobilizes the people, that is to say, it throws them in one way and in one direction.'

The violence of the colonial regime 'and the counter-violence of the native balance each other and respond to each other in an extraordinary reciprocal homogeneity.' This is not equivalence - 'machine-gunning from airplanes and bombardments from the fleet go far beyond in horror and magnitude any answer the natives can make.'

Christianity functions alongside other technologies of pacification - Fanon provocatively places 'DDT which destroys parasites, the bearers of disease, on the same level as the Christian religion which wages war on embryonic heresies and instincts, and on evil as yet unborn.' The 'recession of yellow fever and the advance of evangelization form part of the same balance sheet.' The 'triumphant communiqu\u00e9s from the missions are in fact a source of information concerning the implantation of foreign influences in the core of the colonized people.'

If this citadel is invulnerable to knives and naked fists, it is no longer so when we decide to take into account the context of the Cold War.' Every local incident 'reverberates in the international arena' - the murders at Sharpeville 'shook public opinion for months' and became 'a symbol.'

The settler knows this - 'when their glances meet he ascertains bitterly, always on the defensive, They want to take our place.

'In the colonies the economic substructure is also a superstructure. The cause is the consequence; you are rich because you are white, you are white because you are rich.'

In metropolitan capitalism, 'the educational system, whether lay or clerical, the structure of moral reflexes handed down from father to son, the exemplary honesty of workers who are given a medal after fifty years of good and loyal service' - all these 'aesthetic expressions of respect for the established order serve to create around the exploited person an atmosphere of submission.'

Settler colonialism differs from classical colonialism in three respects: settlers 'rely only initially and temporarily on the empire for their survival,' they 'wish to create a new homeland,' and their 'attitude towards the natives is even harsher' than classical colonialism. The significance is profound: 'If Israel is just a democracy defending itself, then Palestinian bodies such as the PLO are purely terrorist outfits. However, if their struggle is against a colonialist project then they are an anticolonialist movement.' Early settlers revealed the colonial mentality clearly: David Ben-Gurion described Palestinians as 'beit mihush' ('an infested hotbed of pain'). Others wrote: 'The people here are stranger to us than the Russian or Polish peasant... We have nothing in common with the majority of the people living here.'

In the period of colonization when it is not contested by armed resistance, when the sum total of harmful nervous stimuli overstep a certain threshold, the defensive attitudes of the natives give way and they find themselves crowding the mental hospitals.
