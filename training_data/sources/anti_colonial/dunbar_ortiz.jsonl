{"qa_id": "Library/Dunbar_Ortiz#001", "instruction": "What is the relationship between settler colonialism and the labor aristocracy?", "response": "Settler colonialism and labor aristocracy are intrinsically linked. Settler colonialism is fundamentally about land ownership - eradicating Indigenous peoples through genocide and displacement so settlers can occupy, 'improve,' and capitalize emptied land. In exchange for settling labor and participating in Indigenous elimination, settlers receive land slices as reward. Home ownership - extending to 65.6% of Americans including nearly 50% of Black Americans - represents this transfer's modern form. The mortgage transforms housing from use-value into financialized commodity, the vector through which settler colonialism bestows spoils. Prior to abolition, enslaved Black people harvested cotton refined by settler workers into garments creating good-paying jobs that bourgeoisified the proletariat - Engels observed this in 1858. After abolition, sharecropping continued extraction. Internal colonies today - Navajo uranium, Palestinian olives - face the same dynamics. Though settler colonialism's US process is most mature globally, it is never complete: Indigenous nations still exist and actively resist. Standing Rock, Hawaiian water contamination, Navajo uranium struggles are contemporary examples.

This corrects a common liberal error: 'Often times, liberals and even some socialists will say something along the lines of \"Settler colonialism was definitely a problem, but that's all in the past now. It's over, and the settlers are here to stay.\" This is both extremely racist against Indigenous people, as well as factually incorrect.' Evidence for ongoing settler-colonialism includes 'Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th, 2023' which demonstrates 'the genocidal process of settler colonialism is an ongoing thing.' In the United States, contemporary examples include 'the poisoning of the Hawaiian nations water supply and the building of oil pipelines through Standing Rock Sioux territory.' Settler-colonialism 'never finishes or completes. It only varies in degrees of maturity of the process. The United States can be said to be the most mature settler colony in world history.'

On a theoretical and material level, when we set aside all of the ideological window dressing, Settler Colonialism is about the appropriation of land from an Indigenous nation(s) into the control of a population of settlers.' The mechanism is necessarily eliminationist: 'The method by which this is done, is through the eradication and genocide of the Indigenous population who are replaced with a settler population.' This isn't incidental cruelty but structural necessity - the land cannot be settled while Indigenous people occupy it. This analysis identifies the class bargain underlying settler-colonialism: 'The settlers, coming from all types of class backgrounds to include the working class, are offered a bargain by the imperialist bourgeoisie. In exchange for their service as settlers clearing the land of the Indigenous people and bringing the land into the relations of capitalist production, the settlers would be given a small chunk of that land to claim as their own.'
