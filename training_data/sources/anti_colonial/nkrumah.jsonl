{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#001", "instruction": "What is neo-colonialism according to Kwame Nkrumah?", "response": "Nkrumah defined neo-colonialism as imperialism's 'final and perhaps most dangerous stage.' The essence is that a state 'is, in theory, independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty. In reality its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside.' Control is exercised through various methods: garrisons, but more often 'economic or monetary means' - forcing purchase of manufactured goods from the imperial power, payments for running the state, civil servants in policy-dictating positions, and banking control over foreign exchange. Neo-colonialist control need not come from the former colonial power - as with South Vietnam shifting from French to American control. The result: 'foreign capital is used for the exploitation rather than for the development of the less developed parts of the world. Investment under neo-colonialism increases rather than decreases the gap between the rich and the poor countries.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism", "author": "Kwame Nkrumah", "work": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "imperialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#002", "instruction": "Why is neo-colonialism worse than old colonialism?", "response": "Nkrumah argued neo-colonialism is 'the worst form of imperialism. For those who practise it, it means power without responsibility and for those who suffer from it, it means exploitation without redress.' Under old colonialism, the imperial power had to 'explain and justify at home the actions it was taking abroad,' and colonial servants could 'look to its protection.' With neo-colonialism, neither applies. If revolt breaks out, 'the local neo-colonialist government can be sacrificed and another equally subservient one substituted.' Furthermore, neo-colonialism 'postpones the facing of the social issues' and attempts to 'export the social conflicts of the capitalist countries.' The widening gap between rich and poor nations proves this temporary success, but 'the internal contradictions and conflicts of neo-colonialism make it certain that it cannot endure as a permanent world policy.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism", "author": "Kwame Nkrumah", "work": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "dialectics", "imperialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#003", "instruction": "How does neo-colonialism relate to the Welfare State in developed countries?", "response": "Nkrumah revealed that post-WWII, developed nations faced a problem: they couldn't return to pre-war mass unemployment and low living standards. 'No post-war capitalist country could survive unless it became a Welfare State.' Previously, colonies mitigated class conflict, but profits went to capitalists, not workers, causing two-front conflict. The post-war solution was to 'divert colonial earnings from the wealthy class and use them instead generally to finance the Welfare State' - adopted 'even by those working-class leaders who had before the war regarded the colonial peoples as their natural allies against their capitalist enemies at home.' When direct colonialism proved too costly (defeated in Indochina, Algeria), neo-colonialism was instituted. Its principle: breaking up 'large united colonial territories into a number of small non-viable States which are incapable of independent development.' This explains why African unity is the solution.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism", "author": "Kwame Nkrumah", "work": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#004", "instruction": "Why does foreign aid fail to develop neo-colonial countries?", "response": "Nkrumah explained that 'aid to a neo-colonial State is merely a revolving credit, paid by the neo-colonial master, passing through the neo-colonial State and returning to the neo-colonial master in the form of increased profits.' Rulers of neo-colonial states derive authority 'not from the will of the people, but from the support which they obtain from their neo-colonialist masters.' They have 'little interest in developing education, strengthening the bargaining power of their workers... or indeed of taking any step which would challenge the colonial pattern of commerce and industry.' Developed nations' manufacturers object to raising raw material prices or establishing competing industries. Even education is suspect as producing student movements. 'In the end the situation arises that the only type of aid which the neo-colonialist masters consider as safe is military aid' - which 'marks the last stage of neo-colonialism and its effect is self-destructive.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism", "author": "Kwame Nkrumah", "work": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#005", "instruction": "What is the solution to neo-colonialism according to Nkrumah?", "response": "Nkrumah argued that African Unity is the solution. Neo-colonialism's strategy is breaking territories into 'small non-viable States which are incapable of independent development.' These small states 'must be compelled to sell their primary products at prices dictated by the developed nations and buy their manufactured goods at the prices fixed by them.' They 'will be unable to create a large enough market to support industrialisation' and 'lack the financial strength to force the developed countries to accept their primary products at a fair price.' But 'if Africa was united, no major power bloc would attempt to subdue it by limited war.' The 'less developed world will not become developed through the goodwill or generosity of the developed powers. It can only become developed through a struggle against the external forces which have a vested interest in keeping it undeveloped.' African unity defeats the divide-and-rule strategy.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism", "author": "Kwame Nkrumah", "work": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#006", "instruction": "Why does Assata Shakur support the anti-globalization movement?", "response": "Assata sees it as essential for exposing imperialism's new forms: 'When colonialism existed people could see colonialism. When racial segregation existed in its apartheid form, people could see the whites only signs. But it's much more difficult to see the structures of neo-imperialism, neo-colonialism, neo-slavery.' The movement against IMF and World Bank policies reveals these mechanisms. But she calls for a counter-globalization: 'We need a globalization of people who are committed to social justice, to economic justice. We need a globalization of people who are committed to saving this earth, to making sure that the water is drinkable, that the air is breathable.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Nkrumah#007", "instruction": "What is the 'branch-plant economy' and why does Rodney consider it dangerous?", "response": "Rodney explains that the branch-plant economy is a significant and subtle new trend of domination that made its impact felt first in Latin America, then Asia, and is slowly beginning to touch Africa. Its negative effects remain unperceived because many people have been preoccupied with the old forms of the international division of labor, where underdeveloped countries were allocated roles in agriculture or raw materials extraction. Leaders like Nkrumah believed the answer was to create industry in Africa\u2014the dichotomy was simply industry versus agriculture. But imperialism has been able to circumvent this by establishing branch plants of metropolitan corporations, maintaining dependency through a new mechanism that appears to be industrialization but keeps productive control in metropolitan hands.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism", "author": "Kwame Nkrumah", "work": "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "imperialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
