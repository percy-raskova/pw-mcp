It was the new colonies in the West that fuelled the Atlantic slave trade with the African body as commodity, and slavery with the African body providing unpaid labor for colonial plantations, and racism with all its dehumanization of the African body and mind\u2014the negation of African humanity. All these fueled the development of Europe and the West. The major cities of Europe were built by riches from slave trade, slavery and colonialism. Three of the major nuclear powers today\u2014the USA, Britain and France\u2014were also major players in enslavement and colonization.

{"qa_id": "Library/Rodney#002", "instruction": "What does Walter Rodney argue about Marxism as a class ideology?", "response": "Rodney argues that in class societies, all ideologies are class ideologies\u2014all ideologies derive from and support some particular class. Since we grew up in capitalist society, bourgeois ideology is dominant; institutions were created to serve the creation of ideas as commodities that buttress the capitalist system. Scientific Socialism, as Marx suggested himself, arose within capitalist society to speak to the interest of the producers in that society, to speak to the interest of those who are exploited and expropriated. Marxism is explicitly the ideology of the working class and the exploited against the ideology of the exploiters.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa", "author": "Walter Rodney", "work": "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
