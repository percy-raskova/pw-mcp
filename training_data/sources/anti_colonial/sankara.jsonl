Women were encouraged to organize for emancipation - 'The revolution and women's liberation go together. Women hold up the other half of the sky.'

He identified the dual oppression: 'It is true that both the woman and the male worker are condemned to silence by their exploitation. But under the current system, the worker's wife is also condemned to silence by her worker-husband. In other words, in addition to the class exploitation common to both of them, women must confront a particular set of relations that exist between them and men, relations of conflict and violence that use physical differences as their pretext.'

Practically, Burkina practiced austerity: 'Our ministers travel economy-class and have an expense allowance of only 15,000 CFA francs per day... Our minister of labour went to Geneva a little while ago for an international conference. With his daily allowance, there's no way he could expect to find a room in Geneva. He had to go to neighbouring France and share a modest hotel room with his colleagues. This is nothing to be ashamed of.' He invited popular verification: 'When we tell countries we're not going to pay the debt, we can assure them that what is saved won't be spent on prestige projects. We don't want any more of those. What is saved will be used for development.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Thomas Sankara Speaks", "author": "Thomas Sankara", "work": "Thomas Sankara Speaks"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "national-liberation"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Sankara#022", "instruction": "What was Sankara's position on armed African states and inter-African conflict?", "response": "Sankara made a striking argument about African arms purchases: 'When we tell countries we're not going to pay the debt... In particular we will avoid going into debt to buy arms. Because an African country that buys arms can only be doing so to use them against an African country. What African country here can arm itself to defend against the nuclear bomb? No country is capable of that, from the best armed to the least armed. Every time an African country buys a weapon, it's for use against another African country. It's not for use against a European country. It's not for use against an Asian country.' He proposed collective disarmament: 'I am a soldier, and I carry a gun. But Mr. President, I wish we would disarm. Because I carry the only weapon I own. Others have camouflaged the weapons they own.' This connected to his broader analysis: military spending served imperialism and inter-African domination rather than genuine security, draining resources that should flow to development. The solution required African unity \u2013 the 'united front of Addis Ababa' \u2013 not national military competition.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Thomas Sankara Speaks", "author": "Thomas Sankara", "work": "Thomas Sankara Speaks"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "imperialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Sankara#023", "instruction": "What did Sankara say about the concrete meaning of revolution versus revolutionary phrase-mongering?", "response": "Sankara insisted revolution must be measured by material results: 'Our revolution is not a public-speaking tournament. Our revolution is not a battle of fine phrases. Our revolution is not simply for spouting slogans that are no more than signals used by manipulators trying to use them as catchwords, as code words, as a foil for their own display. Our revolution is, and should continue to be, the collective effort of revolutionaries to transform reality, to improve the concrete situation of the masses of our country.' He defined success concretely: 'Our revolution will be worthwhile only if, in looking back, in looking around, in looking ahead, we can say that the Burkinab\u00e8 are, thanks to the revolution, a little happier. Happier because they have clean water to drink, because they have abundant, sufficient food, because they're in excellent health, because they have education, because they have decent housing, because they are better dressed, because they have the right to leisure, because they have enjoyed more freedom, more democracy, more dignity. Our revolution will have a reason to exist only if it can respond concretely to these questions.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Thomas Sankara Speaks", "author": "Thomas Sankara", "work": "Thomas Sankara Speaks"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Sankara#024", "instruction": "How did Sankara link environmental destruction to imperialism?", "response": "Before French officials, Sankara made explicit the connection: 'The battle against the encroachment of the desert is a battle to establish a balance between man, nature, and society. As such, it is a political battle above all, and not an act of fate.' He invoked Marx to explain differential responsibility: 'As Karl Marx said, those who live in a palace do not think about the same things, nor in the same way, as those who live in a hut.' Then directly: 'This struggle to defend the trees and forests is above all a struggle against imperialism. Imperialism is the arsonist setting fire to our forests and our savannas.' This integrated ecological crisis into anti-imperialist analysis \u2013 environmental destruction was not a technical problem to be solved by aid or technology transfer, but a consequence of the same system that produced underdevelopment and debt bondage. The solution required the same revolutionary transformation: genuine independence, popular power, and development oriented toward the needs of the people rather than the extraction requirements of imperialism.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Thomas Sankara Speaks", "author": "Thomas Sankara", "work": "Thomas Sankara Speaks"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial", "imperialism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
