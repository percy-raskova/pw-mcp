{"qa_id": "Library/Butler#001", "instruction": "What did Major General Smedley Butler mean when he said 'war is a racket'?", "response": "Butler, a two-time Medal of Honor recipient and one of the most decorated Marines in US history, defined war as 'possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious' racket. 'A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small inside group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many.' War is 'the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.' Butler documented that World War I created 'at least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires in the United States' while the public 'shoulders the bill' - 'newly placed gravestones, mangled bodies, shattered minds, broken hearts and homes, economic instability, depression and all its attendant miseries, back-breaking taxation for generations and generations.' His conclusion after 33 years in the Marine Corps: 'I had a suspicion that war was a racket; not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "War is a Racket", "author": "Smedley Butler", "work": "War is a Racket"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Butler#002", "instruction": "What specific profit figures did Smedley Butler document from World War I?", "response": "Butler provided devastating documentation of war profiteering. Du Pont powder company: average yearly earnings jumped from $6 million (1910-1914) to $58 million during the war - 'an increase in profits of more than 950 per cent.' Bethlehem Steel: from $6 million yearly average to $49 million. United States Steel: from $105 million to $240 million yearly. Anaconda Copper: from $10 million to $34 million. Utah Copper: from $5 million to $21 million. Grouping these five with three smaller companies: 'total yearly average profits of the pre-war period 1910-1914 were $137,480,000. Then along came the war. The average yearly profits for this group skyrocketed to $408,300,000 - a little increase in profits of approximately 200 per cent.' Senate Document No. 259 reported coal companies making 'between 100 per cent and 7,856 per cent on their capital stock during the war.' Butler estimated the war cost $52 billion, of which '$16,000,000,000 in profits' went 'to a very few. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "War is a Racket", "author": "Smedley Butler", "work": "War is a Racket"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Butler#003", "instruction": "Why did Smedley Butler describe himself as 'a gangster for capitalism'?", "response": "Butler made his famous confession in speeches and writings after retirement: 'I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.' He specified: 'I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.' He concluded: 'Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "War is a Racket", "author": "Smedley Butler", "work": "War is a Racket"}, "classification": {"categories": ["anti-colonial"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
