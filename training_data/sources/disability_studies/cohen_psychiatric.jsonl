Unlike previous Marxist scholars who suggested psychiatry was 'co-opted' by capitalism and could be reformed into a 'genuinely scientific psychology' under socialism, Cohen contends the psy-professions are fundamentally institutions of social control. They were designed to serve ruling class interests by pathologizing deviations from capitalist norms, depoliticizing social problems by individualizing them as personal deficits, and enforcing compliance with exploitative economic relations. For this reason, Cohen argues, they cannot be reformed or rescued from capitalism and have no positive role in a socialist society.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Psychiatric Hegemony", "author": "Bruce Cohen", "work": "Psychiatric Hegemony"}, "classification": {"categories": ["disability-studies"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Cohen_Psychiatric#002", "instruction": "Has psychiatry ever discovered biological markers for mental illness?", "response": "No. Cohen cites extensive research concluding that 'no biological sign has ever been found for any mental disorder. Correspondingly, there is no known physiological etiology.' The APA's own DSM-5 task force, when they began work on the manual in 2002, found that 'the etiology of mental disorders remained unknown. The field still did not have a biological marker or genetic test that could be used for diagnostic purposes.' Furthermore, psychiatrists still cannot distinguish between mentally healthy and mentally sick people. This lack of scientific foundation was dramatically highlighted when Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, was quoted as saying of the DSM's definition of mental disorder: 'There is no definition of a mental disorder... it's bullshit... I mean you can't define it.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Cohen_Psychiatric#003", "instruction": "How has the number of recognized mental disorders changed over time according to DSM editions?", "response": "The growth has been dramatic. The DSM identified 106 mental disorders in 1952, yet now classifies 374. This expansion represents the progressive medicalization of everyday behavior rather than genuine scientific discovery. The rates of 'debilitating mental illness' among US adults increased sixfold between 1955 and 2007. Among young people, the increase was even more extreme\u2014a 35-fold increase between 1997 and 2007. The WHO now estimates 450 million people globally are affected by mental or behavioral disorders, with 100 million taking psychotropic drugs.

College students and researchers presenting at psychiatric hospitals were all admitted and given psychotic labels, despite having no actual mental illness. All subsequent behavior of the researchers\u2014including note-taking\u2014was then labeled by staff as further symptoms of their 'disorder.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Cohen_Psychiatric#005", "instruction": "How does the Marxist analysis explain psychiatry's role in workplace discipline?", "response": "Cohen demonstrates that psychiatry's conceptualization of work as 'therapy' coincided with the development of industrial capitalism in the nineteenth century. Initially, 'work therapy' involved social control and punishment of the unemployed and non-able-bodied in asylums. Today, psychiatry's role has evolved to reinforcing compliant work regimes and 'self-growth' ideologies on precarious workers in neoliberal society. The expansion of the psychiatric discourse into the workplace serves several functions: professional legitimation and expansion of expertise, increased profit through consumption of mental health services, and most importantly, naturalizing unequal and exploitative workplace relations. Studies even pathologize staying up late as 'Machiavellianism, secondary psychopathy, and exploitive narcissism'\u2014reflecting a moral message that good workers rise early and go to bed at reasonable times.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Psychiatric Hegemony", "author": "Bruce Cohen", "work": "Psychiatric Hegemony"}, "classification": {"categories": ["disability-studies"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Cohen_Psychiatric#006", "instruction": "What is the relationship between neoliberalism and the expansion of mental illness categories?", "response": "Cohen demonstrates that neoliberalism has intensified psychiatric hegemony through several mechanisms. The DSM-III (1980) marked a turning point\u2014published at the start of the neoliberal era, youth-related mental illnesses doubled. DSM categories increasingly reference 'work, home, and school' settings, expanding surveillance of behavior in capitalist institutions. Neoliberalism's focus on individual responsibility means social problems like unemployment, poverty, and exploitation are reframed as personal mental health deficits requiring therapy rather than collective political action. The precarious worker is subjected to demands for constant 'self-growth,' flexibility, and emotional labor\u2014backed by the threat of psychiatric labeling for non-compliance. This represents not the corruption of medicine by economic forces, but the fulfillment of psychiatry's essential function: naturalizing capitalist relations as inevitable while pathologizing any resistance.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Psychiatric Hegemony", "author": "Bruce Cohen", "work": "Psychiatric Hegemony"}, "classification": {"categories": ["disability-studies"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Cohen_Psychiatric#007", "instruction": "What does 'psychiatric hegemony' mean in Marxist terms?", "response": "Cohen applies Gramsci's concept of hegemony to explain how psychiatric power operates. Under capitalism, dominant understandings of who we are, what is expected of us, and the limits of our behavior are constructed by the capitalist class and reproduced through state and civil society institutions. We are socialized to accept social and economic disparities as natural and common sense\u2014the inevitable result of differential talent rather than class privilege and exploitation. Psychiatry functions as a key ideological apparatus in this process. It pathologizes deviation from bourgeois norms while presenting itself as neutral medical science.

{"qa_id": "Library/Cohen_Psychiatric#008", "instruction": "What does Cohen say about ADHD as a diagnosis?", "response": "Cohen presents ADHD as a paradigmatic case of psychiatric expansion serving capitalist interests. Three to five percent of US youth were diagnosed with ADHD in the 1970s; current estimates range from 7-11%, including 20% of the male population\u2014a 41% increase in ten years. 3.5 million young people in America are prescribed ADHD medication, nearly six times the 1990 number. The DSM-5 symptomology reads like a list of behaviors inconvenient for teachers: 'fails to give close attention,' 'does not follow through on instructions,' 'has difficulty organizing tasks,' 'avoids tasks that require sustained mental effort,' 'loses things necessary for activities,' 'is easily distracted.' Recent DSM changes expanded ADHD to adults by incorporating workplace productivity measures.
