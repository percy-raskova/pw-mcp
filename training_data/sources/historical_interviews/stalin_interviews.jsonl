These groups exerted a great influence on me and instilled in me a taste for illegal Marxian literature.' When asked if his parents treated him badly, Stalin replied: 'No. My parents were uneducated people, but they did not treat me badly by any means. It was different in the theological seminary of which I was then a student. In protest against the humiliating regime and the jesuitical methods that prevailed in the seminary, I was ready to become, and eventually did become, a revolutionary, a believer in Marxism as the only genuinely revolutionary doctrine.' He described the seminary's methods: 'spying, prying, peering into people's souls, to subject them to petty torment' including searching students' boxes while they were at breakfast.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Stalin Interviews", "author": "Joseph Stalin", "work": "Stalin Interviews"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historical-interviews", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Stalin_Interviews#002", "instruction": "How did Stalin view peasant rebellions like those of Stenka Razin and Pugachev?", "response": "Stalin said Bolsheviks 'have always been interested in such figures as Bolotnikov, Razin, Pugachev' and 'regard the acts of these people as the reflection of the seething unrest of the oppressed classes and of the spontaneous revolt of the peasantry against the feudal yoke.' However, 'no analogy can be drawn between them and the Bolsheviks. Isolated peasant revolts, even when they are not of the bandit and unorganised character of that of Stenka Razin, cannot be successful. Peasant revolts can be successful only if they are combined with revolts of the workers and if the peasant revolts are led by the workers.' Moreover, Razin and Pugachev 'were tsarists: they were opposed to the landlords, but were in favour of a good tsar. That was their motto.' Only combined revolt led by the working class can achieve its aims.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Stalin Interviews", "author": "Joseph Stalin", "work": "Stalin Interviews"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historical-interviews"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Stalin_Interviews#003", "instruction": "Did Stalin believe in fate?", "response": "Stalin explicitly rejected belief in fate: 'No, I do not believe in fate. Bolsheviks, Marxists, do not believe in fate. The idea of fate, of Schicksal, is a superstition, an absurdity, a survival of mythology, like that of the ancient Greeks, whose goddess of fate controlled the destinies of men.' When asked if his survival was mere chance, Stalin replied: 'There are internal and external causes, a combination of which led to the fact that I did not perish. But entirely independent of that, somebody else might have been in my place, for somebody must sit here. Fate is mythical, something contrary to natural law. I do not believe in mysticism.' His survival had reasons, but other causes might have led to the contrary result\u2014'so-called fate has nothing to do with it.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Stalin Interviews", "author": "Joseph Stalin", "work": "Stalin Interviews"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historical-interviews"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Stalin_Interviews#004", "instruction": "What did Stalin identify as the chief war menace in 1936?", "response": "When asked what condition furnishes the chief war menace, Stalin answered simply: 'Capitalism.' When pressed for which specific manifestation, he said: 'Its imperialist, usurpatory manifestation.' He explained: 'You remember how the first World War arose. It arose out of the desire to re-divide the world. Today we have the same background. There are capitalist states which consider that they were cheated in the previous redistribution of spheres of influence, territories, sources of raw materials, markets, etc., and which would want another redivision that would be in their favour. Capitalism, in its imperialist phase, is a system which considers war to be a legitimate instrument for settling international disputes, a legal method in fact, if not in law.' Stalin identified two principal 'seats of war danger': Japan in the Far East, and Germany in Europe.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Stalin Interviews", "author": "Joseph Stalin", "work": "Stalin Interviews"}, "classification": {"categories": ["historical-interviews", "imperialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": true, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Stalin_Interviews#005", "instruction": "How did Stalin describe Soviet elections under the new constitution?", "response": "Stalin explained that suffrage would be 'universal, equal, direct and secret.' While only one party would exist, 'candidates will be put forward not only by the Communist Party, but by all sorts of public, non-Party organisations. And we have hundreds of these.' He anticipated 'very lively election campaigns' conducted around 'numerous, very acute problems, principally of a practical nature.' Voters would measure candidates by practical criteria: 'Have you built a good school or not? Have you improved housing conditions? Are you a bureaucrat? Have you helped to make our labour more effective and our lives more cultured?' Stalin said the new electoral system 'will tighten up all institutions and organisations and compel them to improve their work.

{"qa_id": "Library/Stalin_Interviews#006", "instruction": "Do masses ever rise or are revolutions made by minorities according to Stalin?", "response": "When Wells asked whether 'all revolutions are made by a minority,' Stalin replied: 'To bring about a revolution a leading revolutionary minority is required; but the most talented, devoted and energetic minority would be helpless if it did not rely upon the at least passive support of millions.' Wells pressed: 'At least passive? Perhaps subconscious?' Stalin elaborated: 'Partly also the semi-instinctive and semi-conscious, but without the support of millions, the best minority is impotent.' This dialectical view recognized both the necessity of organized revolutionary leadership and the indispensable role of mass support - the minority provides direction and organization while the masses provide the social force without which revolutionary transformation is impossible.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Stalin Interviews", "author": "Joseph Stalin", "work": "Stalin Interviews"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "historical-interviews", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
