It's a description of the relationship between Marxists and the body of Marxist theory. Like all science, Marxism has an established body of literature describing empirical observations and models built on those observations. Like all scientists, Marxists throughout history have gotten things wrong. We craft scientific theories based on data we have. Sometimes there are details we overlook, so we draw wrong conclusions. Sometimes cultural biases taint those conclusions. Marxism as a science necessarily means cross-disciplinary study. Studying history, anthropology, archaeology, biology, geology, chemistry, materials science, climate science, and more can all give you an increasingly well-rounded background to understand our world. Unlike other sciences, scientific socialism has implications for every aspect of human society. The earnest study of Marxism is necessarily disruptive to your ability to be a passive member of society. This means, more than other science, Marxism breeds ideology. Ideology itself is not a bad thing. A 'non-ideological' person is simply a reactive being moving through life acting on unexamined biases. Ideology constructed by careful study of historical materialism is the only way to govern yourself morally in a world ruled by capital. That's why Marxism must be treated as the science it is. It's all about being principled, not dogmatic. Those principles should be: commitment to objective truth, class consciousness, and improving our material conditions. And above all, scientific socialism requires solidarity.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Historical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Historical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

For example, in the wake of the 2008 crisis, Democrats were gifted such a lay-up. EVERYONE hated the banks that caused the crash - they could have nationalized the banks and bragged about it for the next two years, giving them even more popular support and an expanded majority. Right now, they complain they 'don't have the votes' to codify abortion, instead of putting legislation on the floor, purging their ranks of all who oppose abortion, and demonstrating the party's clear position as the party of abortion (a position with 80% support). I always wanted workers to have economic power in society. But it took an entire lifetime of watching social democracy utterly fail on every level for me to realize we can't just reform capitalism into socialism. That's WHY I started studying Marxism more seriously. Yes, my current political philosophy is now informed by in-depth study of historical materialism. But no one starts their journey with a PhD in Marxism. We all start with a sense of 'Wait... that doesn't seem right...' That's what you're looking for when educating others.

The economic base consists of the productive forces (labor power, means of production) and relations of production (ownership patterns, class relations). Upon this base rises the superstructure: political institutions (the state, legal system), and forms of social consciousness (ideology, religion, philosophy, art). The key insight is that the base is determinant 'in the last instance' - changes in productive forces drive changes in production relations, which in turn transform political and ideological superstructures. However, this is not mechanical determinism: the superstructure has relative autonomy and can react back upon the base. Law can accelerate or retard economic development; ideology can mobilize or pacify classes. Engels warned against 'economic determinism' that ignores this interaction.

The bourgeoisie revolutionized feudal relations when they impeded capitalist development; the proletariat must revolutionize capitalist relations when they impede socialist development.

Subjective factors are consciousness, organization, leadership - the capacity of classes and groups to understand their situation and act collectively. Historical materialism holds that objective conditions are ultimately determinant: revolutionary situations arise from material contradictions, not from revolutionary will alone. But objective conditions do not automatically produce outcomes - they create possibilities that subjective factors must realize. A revolutionary crisis requires both objective conditions (economic breakdown, ruling class inability to rule in the old way, mass unwillingness to be ruled in the old way) and subjective readiness (class consciousness, revolutionary organization, correct leadership).

The state cannot be neutral in class struggle - its function is precisely to maintain existing property relations and suppress challenges to them.

It was understood in such a way that the Jewish homeland of Zion just so happened to be in Palestine which they were entitled to by divine decree.' This analysis emphasizes: 'although it always rests on a foundation of ideology - whether that be American exceptionalism or Jewish Zionism - the fundamental driving force behind the settler colonial system is one of the ownership and control of the land and its wealth.' This is crucial because 'the science of historical materialism teaches us that material factors such as who owns land, are the primary driving force of history.

The British then instrumentalized the Zionist movement: 'The Zionist movement to create a Jewish ethnostate -- a system of government based on the domination and privilege of one ethnicity over all others -- was an up and coming political ideology which already had its eyes set upon colonizing Palestine. Therefore, the British created what was known as Mandatory Palestine by way of the Balfour Declaration of 1917.' The relationship was explicitly colonial: 'the British wanted to expand their empire by means of the settler-colonial system. So they decided to empower the nascent Zionist movement with funding and weapons to begin the process of settling Mandatory Palestine as an extension of the British Empire.' This history reveals that Israel was never a response to antisemitism or a fulfillment of Jewish religious destiny - it was a colonial project serving British imperial interests, later transferred to American imperial interests.

The 'stagist' position holds this is a total order: every society must pass through each stage sequentially. Trotsky's theory of combined and uneven development suggests the order is partial: some historical paths that stagism considers impossible (comparing incomparable elements) are actually valid. A society can have elements of multiple modes coexisting because the material preconditions can be met through imperialism and world-system integration, not just internal development. The partially ordered set model also explains why revolution is possible in 'backward' countries: the relevant ordering is on global productive forces, not national ones.

The base-superstructure thesis claims a functor F: Base \u2192 Superstructure exists, mapping economic structures to corresponding superstructural forms and economic changes to superstructural changes. This formalization clarifies the thesis: it's not that base 'causes' superstructure mechanically, but that structural relationships are preserved under the mapping.

Deterministic historical materialism suggests revolutionary outcomes are constructed from material preconditions - like constructive mathematics that rejects Choice, requiring explicit methods for any claimed existence. Voluntarist deviations treat revolutionary will as sufficient regardless of conditions - unlimited Choice, where mere possibility guarantees a selection. The dialectical position is more nuanced: material conditions don't determine specific outcomes but constrain the set of possibilities. Revolutionary agency operates as a restricted choice function - it can select from among materially possible outcomes but cannot choose non-existent options.
