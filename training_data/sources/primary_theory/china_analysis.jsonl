{"qa_id": "Main/China_Analysis#001", "instruction": "What does 'self-reliance' mean for revolutionary movements and why is it important?", "response": "Self-reliance (zili gengsheng) is a principle emphasizing that revolutionary movements must primarily depend on their own resources, capacities, and the support of their own masses rather than external aid. The Chinese Communist Party, based on Mao's teachings, concluded that giving economic aid to foreign parties was 'corrosive' and promoted dependency. Self-reliance has several dimensions: (1) Ideological independence - each party must analyze its own conditions and develop appropriate strategy rather than following commands from a 'center' (Moscow, Beijing, etc.); (2) Material self-sufficiency - relying on mass contributions and captured resources rather than foreign subsidies; (3) Political sovereignty - making decisions based on national conditions rather than great-power interests. As Mao noted: 'We were given a lot of advice, some good, some bad. We accepted the good and rejected the bad. But if we had accepted some erroneous principle, the responsibility would not have belonged to those who gave the advice, but to us.' This principle guards against both dependency and excuse-making - you cannot blame external forces for your own errors. Self-reliance does not mean isolation from proletarian internationalism, but ensures that international solidarity operates between equals pursuing their own revolutionary paths.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "China Analysis", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "China Analysis"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
