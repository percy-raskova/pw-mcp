{"qa_id": "Library/Cultural_Revolution#001", "instruction": "What role did Mao Zedong Thought play in the founding of the Communist Party of the Philippines?", "response": "Mao Zedong Thought guided the reestablishment of the CPP. It was applied in criticizing, repudiating, and rectifying the Lavaite errors that had weakened the old party from 1942 to the 1960s, as well as in analyzing Philippine history and social circumstances. The CPP adopted the general line of people's democratic revolution through protracted people's war against US imperialism, domestic feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism. Sison had the opportunity to visit China in August 1966 when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was beginning, having enlightening conversations with CPC Central Committee members. He returned in 1967 for a nationwide tour and met Mao Zedong personally at a seminar celebrating the 25th anniversary of 'Talks at Yenan Forum.' The CPP was founded on Mao's 75th birthday, December 26, 1968.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Cultural Revolution", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Cultural Revolution"}, "classification": {"categories": ["imperialism", "primary-theory", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Cultural_Revolution#002", "instruction": "Why does the Communist Party of the Philippines reject the practice of naming theory after individual leaders like 'Gonzalo Thought'?", "response": "The CPP frowns on parties naming their guiding theory after principal leaders (Gonzalo Thought, Prachanda Path, Avakian's New Synthesis) as 'immodest' and 'manifestations of puerile idolatry and the leaders' own self-indulgence and self-glorification.' Sison notes that even during the GPCR, Chinese comrades shied away from calling Mao Zedong Thought 'Maoism' out of modesty. Communists should selflessly advance the revolution and forget about seeking personal fame. It was not Marx and Lenin themselves who labeled their ideas with their names. The CPP adopted 'Maoism' in 1994 only for linguistic symmetry with 'Marxism' and 'Leninism,' not to claim any personal theoretical contributions. Leadership should be proven by revolutionary practice rather than self-proclamation.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Cultural Revolution", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Cultural Revolution"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
