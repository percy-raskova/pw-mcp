Metaphysics fails scientifically - for example, phytoplankton can eat animals and microzooplankton can photosynthesize, blurring supposedly 'pure' categories. As Mao said: 'Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people can talk as much nonsense as they like without basing it on objective reality.' Dialectics helps understand that nature runs on contradiction and transformation. When applied to LGBT questions, metaphysical 'marxists' misuse analysis to suit their needs, when they should recognize that gender, sexuality, and even biological sex are not fixed binaries but complex phenomena requiring dialectical understanding.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Selected Works of Mao", "author": "Mao Zedong", "work": "Selected Works of Mao"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "feminist-marxism", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": true, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Mao#002", "instruction": "What is the Marxist theory of knowledge according to Mao?", "response": "In 'On Practice,' Mao explains that Marxist epistemology places practice in the primary position. 'Man's social practice alone is the criterion of the truth of his knowledge of the external world.' Knowledge begins with experience through practical activity - production, class struggle, scientific experiment. The process moves from perceptual knowledge (sense perceptions, impressions of phenomena) to rational knowledge (concepts, judgments, inferences that grasp essence). But this isn't the end: 'The most important problem does not lie in understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain it, but in applying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world.' Theory must return to practice. 'Practice, knowledge, again practice, and again knowledge. This form repeats itself in endless cycles, and with each cycle the content of practice and knowledge rises to a higher level.' This is the dialectical-materialist unity of knowing and doing.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Selected Works of Mao", "author": "Mao Zedong", "work": "Selected Works of Mao"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Mao#003", "instruction": "How did Mao critique both dogmatism and empiricism?", "response": "Mao wrote 'On Practice' specifically to combat both errors. Dogmatists 'rejected the experience of the Chinese revolution' and 'overawed people with words and phrases from Marxist works, torn out of context' - denying that 'Marxism is not a dogma but a guide to action.' Empiricists 'restricted themselves to their own fragmentary experience and did not understand the importance of theory for revolutionary practice.' Both errors caused 'enormous losses to the Chinese revolution during 1931-34.' Mao explained that 'rational knowledge depends upon perceptual knowledge' - denying this is idealism. But equally, 'perceptual knowledge remains to be developed into rational knowledge' - thinking perception alone is reliable repeats the error of empiricism. 'Perception only solves the problem of phenomena; theory alone can solve the problem of essence.' The correct approach unifies both on the basis of practice.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Selected Works of Mao", "author": "Mao Zedong", "work": "Selected Works of Mao"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Mao#004", "instruction": "What is the essence of guerrilla warfare according to Mao Zedong?", "response": "Mao defined guerrilla warfare as fundamentally revolutionary in character: 'The essence of guerrilla warfare is thus revolutionary in character.' He emphasized that guerrilla operations 'must not be considered as an independent form of warfare. They are but one step in the total war, one aspect of the revolutionary struggle.' Guerrilla warfare is 'the inevitable result of the clash between oppressor and oppressed when the latter reach the limits of their endurance.' Crucially, 'Because guerrilla warfare basically derives from the masses and is supported by them, it can neither exist nor flourish if it separates itself from their sympathies and co-operation.' Mao used the famous fish-water metaphor: guerrillas 'may be likened to water the latter to the fish who inhabit it. How may it be said that these two cannot exist together? It is only undisciplined troops who make the people their enemies and who, like the fish out of its native element cannot live.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Selected Works of Mao", "author": "Mao Zedong", "work": "Selected Works of Mao"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Mao#005", "instruction": "What are Mao's tactical principles for guerrilla warfare?", "response": "Mao's fundamental axiom was: 'Conservation of one's own strength; destruction of enemy strength.' His strategic principle stated: 'Guerrilla strategy must be based primarily on alertness, mobility, and attack.' The famous tactical formula advises: 'When guerrillas engage a stronger enemy, they withdraw when he advances; harass him when he stops; strike him when he is weary; pursue him when he withdraws.' Additional principles include: 'In guerrilla warfare, select the tactic of seeming to come from the east and attacking from the west; avoid the solid, attack the hollow; attack; withdraw; deliver a lightning blow, seek a lightning decision.' On mobility, Mao wrote: 'When the situation is serious, the guerrilla must move with the fluidity of water and the ease of the blowing wind.' He compared the guerrilla leader to a fisherman 'who, with his nets, is able both to cast them and to pull them out in awareness of the depth of the water, the strength of the current or the presence of any obstructions.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Selected Works of Mao", "author": "Mao Zedong", "work": "Selected Works of Mao"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Mao#006", "instruction": "What is the role of the masses in guerrilla warfare according to these theorists?", "response": "All four traditions center mass support as decisive. Mao's fish-water metaphor: guerrillas 'cannot exist nor flourish if it separates itself from their sympathies and co-operation.' He established the mass line requiring voluntary cooperation: 'We must not force them, for if we do, it will be ineffective.' The PFLP articulated: 'The final purpose behind our action is the masses: the freedom of the masses, the dignity of the masses, the life of the masses, the fulfillment of their needs, the guarantee of their future.' Che emphasized: 'The guerrilla fighter needs full help from the people of the area. This is an indispensable condition.' The Fedai, facing conditions where mass organization was impossible, theorized armed action as the means to break psychological barriers: demonstrating the enemy is vulnerable transforms passive masses into active supporters.
