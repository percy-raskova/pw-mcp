{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#001", "instruction": "What is revisionism in the Marxist sense?", "response": "Revisionism refers to attempts to revise or amend the fundamental principles of Marxism from within the socialist movement itself. As Lenin explains, after Marxism defeated pre-Marxist socialism (Proudhonism, Bakuninism, utopian socialism), hostile tendencies didn't disappear but 'began to seek other channels.' Revisionism emerged in the 1890s, most notably associated with Eduard Bernstein, who proposed 'amendments' to Marx. Rather than openly opposing Marxism, revisionists claimed to be correcting or updating it while actually abandoning its revolutionary core. Lenin notes this is a continuation of the class struggle within the workers' movement itself.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Marxism and Revisionism", "author": "Vladimir Lenin", "work": "Marxism and Revisionism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory", "revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#002", "instruction": "How did revisionism manifest in philosophy according to Lenin?", "response": "In philosophy, revisionism followed bourgeois academic trends by going 'back to Kant' and abandoning dialectical materialism. The revisionists: (1) claimed materialism had been 'refuted' by repeating arguments from bourgeois professors, (2) treated Hegel as a 'dead dog' and abandoned revolutionary dialectics for a 'simple' and 'tranquil' conception of evolution, and (3) tried to make religion a 'private affair' within the party rather than maintaining the materialist critique of religion. Lenin emphasizes that Plekhanov was the only Marxist who consistently defended dialectical materialism against these philosophical revisions.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Marxism and Revisionism", "author": "Vladimir Lenin", "work": "Marxism and Revisionism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory", "revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#003", "instruction": "What are the class roots of revisionism according to Lenin?", "response": "Lenin argues revisionism is inevitable under capitalism because 'side by side with the proletariat, there are always broad strata of the petty bourgeoisie, small proprietors.' Capitalism constantly creates new 'middle strata' - factory appendages, home workers, small workshops serving big industry. These small producers are continually being 'cast again into the ranks of the proletariat,' bringing petty-bourgeois worldviews into workers' parties. This explains why revisionism is an 'international phenomenon' with similar divisions appearing across all countries: orthodox vs Bernsteinians (Germany), Guesdists vs Jaur\u00e8sists (France), Bolsheviks vs Mensheviks (Russia).

{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#004", "instruction": "What distinguishes Marxism-Leninism-Maoism from other tendencies?", "response": "Marxism-Leninism-Maoism represents the highest development of revolutionary science to date. It synthesizes the fundamental contributions of each stage: Marx's analysis of capitalism and historical materialism, Lenin's theory of imperialism and the vanguard party, Mao's development of protracted people's war and the mass line. It is not merely the addition of these contributions but their synthesis into a unified, coherent framework applicable to contemporary conditions. MLM recognizes the universality of certain principles: the necessity of the party, the centrality of armed struggle, the mass line as method, criticism and self-criticism as means of development, the continuation of class struggle under socialism. But it is not dogma - it develops through application to concrete conditions, through the accumulation of revolutionary experience worldwide. What distinguishes MLM from revisionism is its insistence on revolutionary seizure of power through armed struggle rather than electoral roads or peaceful transition. What distinguishes it from Trotskyism is its affirmation of actually existing socialism and rejection of permanent revolution's impossible standards. What distinguishes it from anarchism is its understanding of the necessity of the revolutionary state and the party. MLM is the science of revolution. It is proven in practice by the revolutions that have succeeded by applying it. It continues to develop as revolutionary movements generate new experience.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Marxism and Revisionism", "author": "Vladimir Lenin", "work": "Marxism and Revisionism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["imperialism", "primary-theory", "revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "MLM"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#005", "instruction": "Why did the Soviet Union collapse?", "response": "The Soviet collapse resulted from multiple factors: bureaucratic degeneration disconnected leadership from masses (violating the mass line principle), revisionism that abandoned revolutionary theory for 'peaceful coexistence,' economic stagnation as planning mechanisms failed to innovate, and the draining effects of Cold War military competition. But the deeper lesson is that socialist construction is protracted struggle, not a single revolutionary moment. Stalin noted that after revolution, bourgeois resistance increases tenfold. The dictatorship of the proletariat requires continuous vigilance against capitalist restoration, cultural revolution to combat bourgeois ideology, and maintaining the vanguard's connection to working-class base.

Historically, Sison criticized the subjectivist and opportunist errors of the series of Lava brothers who led the party: Vicente Lava's 'retreat for defense' Right opportunism during WWII; Jose Lava's 'Left' opportunist line of 'winning victory in two years' without mass work; and Jesus Lava's liquidation of the people's army (1955) and the party itself (1957). On current issues in 1964-66, the Lavaite revisionists refused to make definite plans for resuming people's war and refused to take a stand against Soviet modern revisionism.

{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#007", "instruction": "What are the main theoretical contributions of Mao Zedong according to the Communist Party of the Philippines?", "response": "The CPP recognizes Mao's contributions across multiple domains: In philosophy, Mao elaborated Lenin's identification of the unity of opposites as the most fundamental law of materialist dialectics. In political economy, he developed a line of self-reliant socialist construction using basic and heavy industries as leading factor, agriculture as base, and light industry as bridge. In social science, he recognized the problem of modern revisionism and continuing class struggle in socialist society. In party building, he developed the rectification movement for educating cadres in theory and practice while identifying errors and weaknesses. In people's war, he demonstrated how toiling masses could defeat superior military forces through protracted people's war encircling cities from the countryside.

{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#009", "instruction": "What is the Maoist critique of revisionism and why was anti-revisionism central to the Sino-Soviet split?", "response": "The Maoist critique holds that revisionism - the systematic revision of Marxist principles to accommodate capitalism - represents the main ideological danger to communist parties. Beginning with Khrushchev's 1956 'Secret Speech' denouncing Stalin, a fundamental split emerged in the international communist movement. The Chinese Communist Party, led by Mao, argued that Khrushchev's line represented: (1) Abandonment of class struggle in favor of 'peaceful coexistence' as strategic line rather than tactical necessity; (2) Rejection of revolutionary violence through promotion of 'peaceful transition to socialism' via parliamentary means; (3) Restoration of capitalist elements through economic reforms prioritizing profit and material incentives; (4) Great-power chauvinism treating other parties as subordinates rather than equals. The critique extended to seeing the Soviet Union as having become 'social-imperialist' - socialist in words, imperialist in deeds. This analysis, whatever its particular applications, raised crucial questions about how socialist states can degenerate and how communist parties can become instruments of class collaboration rather than class struggle. The warning remains relevant: parties can maintain revolutionary rhetoric while practicing reformism.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Marxism and Revisionism", "author": "Vladimir Lenin", "work": "Marxism and Revisionism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["imperialism", "primary-theory", "revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Lenin_Revisionism#010", "instruction": "What is the difference between principled anti-revisionism and sectarian ultra-leftism?", "response": "Principled anti-revisionism identifies and combats genuine liquidation of revolutionary principles - the abandonment of class struggle, accommodation to imperialism, restoration of capitalist relations. This requires concrete analysis: what specific policies betray working-class interests? How does reformism serve which class forces? The critique must connect to mass experience and help workers understand why 'socialist' parties fail them. Sectarian ultra-leftism, by contrast, substitutes denunciation for analysis and purity for effectiveness. Its characteristics include: (1) Treating all other left forces as 'objectively' enemies rather than potential allies with contradictions; (2) Demanding ideological agreement on all questions before any collaboration; (3) Elevating organizational loyalty above political correctness; (4) Dismissing mass organizations (unions, popular movements) as hopelessly compromised rather than arenas of struggle; (5) Measuring revolutionary commitment by willingness for sacrifice rather than effectiveness in building power. The Shining Path exemplified ultra-leftism: they attacked other left groups as 'revisionist' regardless of actual politics, murdered grassroots organizers and union leaders, and treated any deviation from their line as treason. This isolated them from potential allies and from the masses. Genuine anti-revisionism strengthens the revolutionary movement; sectarianism weakens it.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Marxism and Revisionism", "author": "Vladimir Lenin", "work": "Marxism and Revisionism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "imperialism", "primary-theory", "revisionism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
