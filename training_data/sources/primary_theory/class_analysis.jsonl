The member who wants the organization's resources and support but won't follow its decisions; the cadre who claims special circumstances excuse them from rules that bind others; the leader who enforces discipline on subordinates but considers themselves above it - all manifest this tendency. It reflects petty-bourgeois individualism: the belief that one's own judgment is superior to collective wisdom, that rules are for ordinary people. Democratic centralism requires accepting decisions once made, even when you disagreed. The right to argue your position exists within the process; once the collective decides, discipline means implementation.

Classes emerge when productive forces develop sufficiently to create a surplus beyond immediate survival needs. This surplus makes exploitation possible - some can live from others' labor. The division of labor, particularly between mental and manual work, crystallizes into class divisions. Private property in means of production institutionalizes the division between those who own and those who must sell labor power. Class is thus not primarily about income or lifestyle but about structural position in production relations. This position determines objective class interests regardless of individual consciousness - though developing class consciousness of these interests is essential for class struggle.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Class Analysis", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Class Analysis"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

Science reveals what is; commitment motivates action to change it. Some claim this combination is contradictory: if Marxism is scientific, it should be neutral; if it's committed, it must be biased. But this rests on a false separation. In class society, all social theory serves class interests - 'neutrality' means serving dominant class interests unconsciously. Marxism openly declares its partisanship while insisting this enhances rather than compromises its scientific character. Why? Because the proletariat, alone among classes, has objective interest in understanding society truthfully. Ruling classes benefit from ideological mystification; the proletariat benefits from clarity. Revolutionary commitment motivates rigorous analysis because illusions are costly in struggle. Conversely, scientific understanding intensifies commitment by revealing exploitation's full scope and transformation's real possibility.

The bourgeoisie benefit most through the exploitation of reproductive labor - 'any form of labor which allows the proletariat to reproduce its ability to go into work every day.'

'If workers consciously chose not to work, then the bourgeoisie would not profit!' The bourgeoisie therefore need reproductive labor performed but want to pay as little as possible for it - ideally nothing. Patriarchy accomplishes this through ideology: 'Patriarchy is the reason why homemaking is viewed as women's work, and also the reason that work isn't paid any compensation.' Notice the correlation: 'all these examples of reproductive labor just so happen to be in professions that are traditionally viewed as feminine. They all also happen to be among the lowest paid in terms of wages.'

Political police can use drug charges as leverage to create informants while appearing to enforce neutral laws. Second, drug enforcement is racially structured: 'Some drugs are more legal than others.

Third, and most fundamentally, the drug trade funds covert operations: Operation Gladio 'was funded by the drug trade of Heroin. This consolidated control over the drug trade for funding covert ops.'

Class position satisfies all three: you're in the same class as yourself, if A is in the same class as B then B is in the same class as A, and class membership is transitive. The equivalence relation is defined by relationship to the means of production - those who must sell their labor power to survive form one equivalence class (proletariat), those who own means of production and purchase labor power form another (bourgeoisie).

The working class is dense in the space of social questions under capitalism. Every domain of social life - healthcare, housing, education, culture, environment, technology - contains working-class presence and working-class stakes. There is no 'pure' bourgeois question untouched by labor. This density explains why the working class is the universal class: its particular interests connect to every social issue. The bourgeoisie, by contrast, is not dense - there exist regions of social concern (subsistence, workplace safety, job security) where bourgeois presence is absent or purely parasitic. Hegemonic strategy involves the ruling class attempting to make its positions dense through ideological work - presenting bourgeois interests as universal, present in every political neighborhood.

The working class exists as an objective partition of society based on relations to production (class-in-itself) before it recognizes itself as such (class-for-itself). The partition exists mathematically regardless of whether its members know which cell they occupy. A class-in-itself is the partition as defined by the equivalence relation. A class-for-itself is when the members of a cell recognize their common membership, understand the structure of the partition, and act collectively based on this understanding. The mathematical framing reveals something important: the partition's existence is independent of consciousness, but political action requires knowledge of partition structure.

Fascism believed in hierarchy not in terms of class but in terms of service to Volk or nation as exemplified by the leader. Western fascisms adopted the corporate state ideal - workers and managers sitting together, though not as equals (the manager was the 'leader'). But this was ultimately secondary: if all members of Volk and nation shared a common myth, a common soul, their participation in government need only be symbolized by the leader who activated their shared human natures. Fascism stressed social justice but would bring it through the nation, not through imposing equality.

Their exclusion from society had been so total that purely economic considerations could take second place to the promise of ending alienation and joining an organic community. Economics was indeed one of fascism's least important considerations. Jose Primo de Rivera of Spain's Falange believed 'people have never been moved by anyone save the poets.' Belgian fascist L\u00e9on Degrelle called Hitler, Mussolini, and Codreanu 'poets of revolution.' The mystical side dominated - a fascist revolution must recognize the 'primacy of the spiritual.'

The doctrine correctly recognizes that consciousness has material force - that ideas, perceptions, and will are causally effective, not mere epiphenomena. However, it treats cognition abstractly, divorced from the material conditions that produce it. Consciousness is not simply a neurological phenomenon to be manipulated through information inputs; it emerges from lived experience, class position, and material interests. A peasant's resistance to dispossession cannot be 'reframed' away because it reflects real material conditions, not merely cognitive errors. The doctrine also ignores that cognitive manipulation has limits when confronted with material reality - you cannot indefinitely convince hungry people they are fed. Most fundamentally, neocortical warfare assumes asymmetric capacity: that imperial powers can manipulate while targets remain passive recipients. But subordinate populations develop their own cognitive defenses, counter-narratives, and resistant consciousness through struggle itself. Class consciousness emerges not from information operations but from the experience of exploitation and resistance.

The African petty bourgeoisie chose policies that maintained dependency rather than building self-sufficient food systems.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Class Analysis", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Class Analysis"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
