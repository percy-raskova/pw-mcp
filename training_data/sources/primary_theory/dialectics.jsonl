But in socialist society there is no longer unemployment, no exploitation, no oppression of nationalities. In socialist society everyone is obliged to work, although he does not, in return for his labour receive according to his requirements, but according to the quantity and quality of the work he has performed.

Communist society represents a higher stage: 'Only when we have succeeded in creating a system under which, in return for their labour, people will receive from society, not according to the quantity and quality of the labour they perform, but according to their requirements, will it be possible to say that we have built communist society.'", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#002", "instruction": "What is Abstraction and how does it function in the formation of concepts?", "response": "Abstraction is the mental process of isolating essential properties common to a class of objects while disregarding their individual, accidental features. When we form the concept 'triangle,' we abstract from the particular material, size, color, and location of any specific triangle to grasp what is common to all triangles - a closed three-sided figure. This process is essential to scientific knowledge: sensory experience gives us only individual, transient objects, but science seeks to understand their essence - the common, stable, lasting qualities underlying individual phenomena. Abstraction enables us to move from appearance to essence, from the particular to the general. Crucially, abstractions are not arbitrary mental constructs but reflect real properties of the material world. The essence of the triangle existed before humans conceived it; our concept is secondary, a reflection of material reality. This distinguishes materialist epistemology from idealism, which inverts the relationship and treats concepts as primary, with material things as mere manifestations of ideas.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#003", "instruction": "What is Historical Materialism and what makes it scientific?", "response": "Historical materialism is the extension of dialectical materialism to the study of society and history. It holds that social being determines social consciousness - that the material conditions of life, particularly how people produce their means of existence, shape their political institutions, ideas, and culture. Before Marx, history appeared as chaos - the actions of great individuals, the clash of ideas, the rise and fall of states with no discernible pattern. Historical materialism revealed the material basis underlying this apparent chaos: the development of productive forces, the struggle of classes, the contradiction between forces and relations of production. This made history scientifically comprehensible for the first time. Historical materialism is scientific because it: (1) identifies objective laws operating independently of human will; (2) grounds explanation in material conditions accessible to investigation; (3) generates testable predictions about social development; (4) has been confirmed by historical experience. It enables understanding not just what happened but why - the necessary connections beneath contingent events.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#004", "instruction": "What is Matter according to dialectical materialism?", "response": "Lenin provided the definitive philosophical definition: 'Matter is a philosophical category denoting the objective reality which is given to man by his sensations, and which is copied, photographed and reflected by our sensations, while existing independently of them.' This definition avoids reducing matter to any particular physical property (atoms, mass, extension) that advancing science might revise. When physics discovered that atoms were divisible, that mass varied with velocity, idealists proclaimed 'matter has disappeared.' Lenin countered that only a particular conception of matter's structure had disappeared; the philosophical concept - objective reality existing independently of consciousness - remained untouched. This concept is inexhaustible: science progressively deepens our understanding of matter's properties and forms, but can never exhaust the infinite material world. The definition also establishes the epistemological relationship: matter exists independently of consciousness, acts on our sense organs to produce sensations, and can be known through these sensations - rejecting both idealism and agnosticism.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#005", "instruction": "What is the Negation of the Negation and how does it operate in development?", "response": "The negation of the negation is a law of dialectical development describing how things develop through successive transformations that preserve what is valuable from earlier stages while advancing to higher forms. Simple negation would mean mere destruction - the end of development. Dialectical negation preserves and transforms: a seed germinates, negating itself as seed to become a plant; the plant produces seeds, negating itself to become seeds again - but not the original single seed; rather, many seeds incorporating all the plant's development. Each negation is also a new beginning. In society: primitive communism (no classes) is negated by class society; class society will be negated by communism - but not a return to primitive conditions; rather, communism at a higher level, incorporating all the productive development of class society without its exploitation. The negation of the negation explains why development is not circular (mere repetition) nor linear (simple progress) but spiral - returning to earlier themes at higher levels, preserving and advancing simultaneously.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#006", "instruction": "What is the Unity of opposites and why is it the most fundamental law of dialectics?", "response": "The unity and conflict of opposites holds that every phenomenon contains within itself contradictory aspects that are mutually dependent (unity) yet mutually exclusive and struggling (conflict). This internal contradiction is the source of all motion and development - things change not primarily from external causes but from internal contradictions. Capitalist society contains the contradiction between social production and private appropriation; this internal contradiction drives its development and will ultimately produce its transformation. The unity of opposites means neither can exist without the other: bourgeoisie and proletariat presuppose each other; one is defined by its relation to the other. The conflict of opposites means they struggle constantly, with one or the other dominant at different stages. Lenin called this law 'the essence of dialectics' because it explains self-movement - why things develop without external push. Understanding contradiction enables us to identify the specific contradictions driving any phenomenon's development, distinguish principal from secondary contradictions, and determine correct strategy for advancing transformation.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#007", "instruction": "Why does dialectical materialism assert that the world is Knowable (contra agnosticism)?", "response": "Agnosticism - the view that we cannot know things as they really are, only appearances - is refuted by the entire history of human practice. Kant argued we know only phenomena (appearances), never things-in-themselves. But if our knowledge bore no relation to reality, how could we successfully act on it? Industry, medicine, engineering work because knowledge corresponds to how things actually are. When we produce aniline dye from coal tar, we prove we know the 'thing-in-itself' of coal tar's chemical constitution - not absolutely and completely, but genuinely. Practice bridges the gap agnosticism posits between knowledge and reality. Engels wrote: 'From the moment we turn these substances to our own use... we put to an infallible test the correctness of our sense-perceptions.' Lenin added that agnosticism is vacillation between materialism and idealism - it denies we can know whether matter exists independently of mind, thus leaving room for idealism despite appearing neutral. Consistent materialism affirms: objective reality exists, acts on our senses, and can be known with increasing accuracy through practice-tested theory.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Main/Dialectics#008", "instruction": "What is the relationship between dialectical negation and Boolean complement in set theory?", "response": "Boolean set complement and dialectical negation are fundamentally different operations. In Boolean logic with universal set U, the complement \u0100 satisfies A \u222a \u0100 = U and A \u2229 \u0100 = \u2205 - everything is either in A or its complement, nothing is in both. Dialectical negation (Aufhebung) operates differently: the negation both cancels and preserves what it negates. When capitalism negates feudalism, it doesn't simply replace it with 'non-feudalism' - it preserves transformed feudal elements (commodity production, which existed in feudalism, becomes generalized; hierarchical social relations persist in new forms). The dialectical negation of A produces not \u0100 but A' - something that has emerged through negating A while incorporating elements of A at a higher level. Socialism as the negation of capitalism will similarly preserve capitalism's achievements (productive forces, global integration, certain organizational forms) while abolishing its defining relations (private ownership, wage labor, production for profit). This non-Boolean character of dialectical logic cannot be captured in classical set theory but requires more sophisticated mathematical structures, perhaps drawing from paraconsistent logic or category theory.", "source": {"namespace": "Main", "article_title": "Dialectical Materialism", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "Dialectical Materialism"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "political-economy", "primary-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
