It's demonstrably untrue that trans people are more likely to be racist or pro-empire or 'had a Nazi phase.' Are there trans Nazis? Obviously - there are also Black Nazis. That doesn't mean there's any link whatsoever. Those are counter-examples. In fact, out of every subpopulation of white people, trans people are the least likely BY FAR to be fascists. The very premise of the 'concern' rests on fundamental skewing of who trans people are. The perception of trans people as disproportionately white, wealthy, landed gentry with fancy tech jobs and vested interest in empire's well-being is completely backwards. There is no 'just asking questions' on this matter - it's an open and shut case, and the only reason to reopen it is to wedge chauvinism in like a crowbar and pry it open. This also applies to claims that Israel is progressive on queer issues: in 2022, Israel had 3,309 reported incidents of anti-queer violence in a population of 9.4 million. The US had 11,600 in 332 million - a TENFOLD difference in rate.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#024", "instruction": "What does the Kornilov Affair actually teach about revolutionary alliances?", "response": "The Kornilov Affair was not 'the Kadet party gaining power' through elections but an outright armed coup attempt. The coup was led by Lavr Kornilov, whom Kerensky himself had recently appointed commander-in-chief. Kornilov and supporting military officers were motivated by desire to crush both the Petrograd Soviet and the Bolsheviks. The Soviet was much more powerful and influential within the city than the provisional government. They organized armed defense against Kornilov's forces. It was Kerensky who allied with THEM out of self-preservation, not the other way around. Several Bolshevik leaders, arrested since the July Days, were released to help defend the city. The Soviet and Bolsheviks were armed and ready to meet imminent violence. Bolsheviks conducted sabotage efforts to deter Kornilov's advance. At no point did Lenin or any Bolshevik say 'Alright, time to swallow our pride and vote for the lesser of two evils!' Instead, Kerensky crawled on his knees, begging them to defend him against the threat he had helped create. So unless your proposed 'temporary alliance' involves communists already holding equal or greater power to government, and liberals freeing and arming us to meet impending fascist violence with our own violent resistance, the comparison has no relevance.

It's viscerally fun to watch people struggle to survive in apocalyptic scenarios, and even more fun when survival involves blowing heads off monsters. But there is simply no version of the zombie genre that does not lionize fascist mythemes - the mindless horde, the pure survivors, the collapse of civilization from external infection, the need to violently defend against the corrupted masses. Try vampires on for size instead. Oppressive, clever, willfully sinister lords who drain your life force and exert dominance over humanity, whose rule must be violently overthrown by ordinary yet highly organized human beings. The vampire metaphor captures class dynamics: parasitic aristocracy feeding on workers, operating through seduction and manipulation rather than mindless swarm, requiring collective organized resistance rather than individual survivalism.

Although we need calories for survival, the very process of metabolizing food molecules is intrinsically harmful to cells, accelerates aging, and contributes significantly to mortality. Lab rats allowed to eat as much as they want live substantially shorter lives than rats with restricted diets - not because of obesity, but as a direct function of caloric intake. Aerobic respiration produces reactive oxygen species that react with and break apart DNA, causing damage that can't always be repaired. To head off cells becoming cancerous, cells undergo apoptosis - programmed cell death. Over the course of your life, every calorie you consume generates more ROS's, each line of defense gets slowly overwhelmed, and eventually cell death outpaces the growth of new cells. This dialectical tension between acquiring energy and the damage wrought by its acquisition is largely inescapable. We can't resolve the fundamental contradiction without running afoul of the systems built up around that tension. ROS signaling is used for development and cell growth, so tampering with it too much impairs the very processes we need.

The implication is that, as long as the people have the final say in who leads them, those leaders will act as their 'representatives.' We know this process isn't working. Public polling shows that people increasingly understand the government serves a small group of powerful people instead of them. The blame is often laid at the feet of corporate donations, but it goes much deeper. The entire electoral process was DESIGNED to launder public sentiment without too much danger of actually serving the people. Think of 'sham elections' in fascist Italy, Germany, and Japan. We intuitively understand that ballots with a giant 'Ja,' a tiny 'Nein,' plus armed security forces don't actually tell us what the people want. So why did they run these elections? The 'legitimacy' is actually for the base - it's not exactly a trick, just an empty affirmation. The simple act of voting for the ruling party helps build loyalty, making supporters more likely to comply with policies, act as 'citizen deputies,' and create a culture of unity. For these regimes, elections aren't about making government responsive to the people - they make a galvanized subset feel enhanced allegiance. In your 'real' democracy with multiple parties, your options aren't really choices. You already know who aligns with your values and who is absolutely NOT an option.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#033", "instruction": "How did bourgeois democracy emerge and what does it serve?", "response": "Bourgeois revolutions throughout history were, in essence, ways to establish capital as the deciding force in governmental affairs, rather than heredity and force. This was presented to the people as democratic liberalization - that now 'anyone can rule if they win elections!' The fact that the goal was never to give power to 'the people' should be made obvious by who was allowed to vote in the beginning: property-holders. Constitutions were invariably drafted by holders of capital. Suffrage was granted in stages, only once it became more disruptive to deny the vote than to admit new groups into the process. When suffrage is deemed too disruptive, it is simply abrogated - by legislative, administrative, or military means. There is no real danger to capital of needing to give up hegemony as a result of the government it helped create. Electoral politics gives capital a pressure gauge to determine how seriously to take public discontent. Reforms, when they happen, are short-term concessions to relieve tension, made with the understanding they can always be undone within the 'democratic' framework, and that capital won't need to accept permanent loss of power. Democratic 'rights' are portrayed that way to absolve the ruling class of consequences, but are deliberately set up to mitigate class solidarity and divide the working class into manageable constituencies. By 'allowing' these constituencies to vote in atomized self-interests that don't align along class lines, capital operates in the same spirit as sham elections.

This is the lesson we relearn every moment: our very identity relies on giving and receiving oppression. At different strata of society, we each become acclimated to different measures of oppressing and being oppressed. Whatever that balance, we are taught to see it as natural and integral to our place.

Through reproduction of social relations, oppressor and oppressed are dehumanized. Both elements exist in us all, which helps cement the righteousness of our role. Were we not to oppress, we would be oppressed all the more. From this realization we can reckon with the source of true liberation politics. We must grapple with the notion that to seek liberation is deeply uncomfortable. It is a challenge to our own identities - imposed though they may be. We feel secure in oppression. Our race, gender, nation, religion, speech, family - none are left untouched by this vital poison. Liberation must form new conceptions of these social forms, expressions divorced from the oppressive construct or crafted in opposition. This is the source of fascist obsession with maintaining 'traditional' form - to be queer, childless, to celebrate one's racial heritage, to have diverse religious views are destructive to the edifice.

This is wrong. Markets PRECEDE capitalism. Markets CREATED capitalism. Markets are the primordial swamp in which those best at advantaging themselves accumulate social power. Capital depends on markets to exist, so it uses its power to violently and culturally enforce markets. Markets drive imperialism, create starvation, inflict abject poverty, foment national and racial enmity, trigger crises of production, and - most crucially - allow a tiny minority of parasitic capitalists to gobble up our world while belching out toxic fumes that destroy us all. A society that works to eliminate markets is clearly socialist. Without markets, capitalism withers. The greatest failings of socialist experiments have always been in reintroducing markets. The workers' relationship to means of production is critically important. But the existence of markets is the fundamental driver of the lopsided relationship to production we currently see.

The structure of organized labor needs substructure and superstructure. Superstructure is the cooperation of union federations. It's important for coordination of tactics, solidarity actions, setting priorities, and putting boots on the ground. It's crucial for multiplying efforts, making sure all fights get escalated to maximum level. Sufficiently advanced union federations across industries can direct and support all working class members - massive strike funds, fill out pickets, train organizers, dictate legislation, support displaced workers. Substructure is crucial as the engine of the labor movement. Workers who are deeply engaged, know each other, are highly trained organizers, and most importantly have endless contingency plans in place. Expect capital to constantly undermine us, and be ready to rebuff and rebuild. The ability of empowered substructure to constantly reengage rank-and-file workers, even without the legal entity of a union, is of utmost importance. A powerful labor movement needs to be able to ignore blatantly anti-union laws, such as prohibition against sympathy strikes. This means if a union is decertified for violating unjust regulations, its former members need to be ready to jump in and form a union again. They need to be capable of wildcat strikes, where workers are protected not by legal stricture but by economic sway over the boss. Without these substructures and superstructures, unions naturally default to the service model: negotiating contracts, filing grievances, and slowly hemorrhaging disaffected members.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#038", "instruction": "Why is COVID unlikely to evolve to become less dangerous?", "response": "There is a persistent myth, especially among better-informed folks, that COVID will inevitably evolve to become lower impact. The idea is that the virus 'wants' to trade lethality for infectiousness since dead hosts can't spread it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. We've known for a long time that you can spread COVID while asymptomatic. In fact, your HIGHEST level of infectiousness is just before symptoms show up (if they ever do). You can also spread COVID even if you NEVER develop symptoms. In viruses, mutations naturally occur every time genetic material is replicated, affecting their traits. Most do nothing, some kill the virus, some make it more or less infectious, some make it more or less lethal. Evolution works through selective pressure - if the environment makes it harder for some individuals to replicate based on traits, you'll see more individuals with 'better' traits. In some viruses, there is actually a trade-off because hosts fighting rapidly spreading infection tend to feel weak, avoid other people. But COVID has a secret weapon: it can spread pretty far WITHOUT triggering symptoms. The virus can infect cells your body uses to kickstart the immune response (symptoms), slowing them down. This lets the virus spread before you know it's there. That means there is no selective pressure against spreading rapidly within a host, since it can do so without triggering symptoms that might hamper finding new hosts.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#040", "instruction": "What is the difference between hegemony through repression versus assimilation?", "response": "Modern liberal hegemony often prefers to ASSIMILATE nonconformity rather than repress it. It's a useful tool for naturalizing the social form and deradicalizing what would otherwise be hyper-oppressed sectors of the working class. That's really the main conflict between conservatism and liberalism: whether to maintain hegemony through repression or assimilation. Either way, the specific nature of particular non-conformity is less relevant than you might think. To be clear: non-monogamy is neither a prerequisite for revolutionary thought nor does it inherently foster it. Same with every other social relation that doesn't perfectly conform to hegemony. You can be polyamorous and reactionary, you can be monogamous and revolutionary. This somehow fundamentally misunderstands capital (which by its very nature cannot remain stagnant) AND underestimates the role of capitalist cultural hegemony in filtering every human interaction through the lens of maintaining the existing social form. Wherever possible, liberal hegemony absorbs challenges to itself - taking radical demands and defanging them by incorporating surface-level aesthetics while preserving power structures. Understanding this helps explain why representation without material change is a dead end, why corporate pride campaigns coincide with union-busting, why diversity initiatives don't threaten shareholder returns.

Elder care, emergency services, transport, food, communication, education - these are all forms of infrastructure that shouldn't be handled on an individual level because many people can't easily do these things. You may say 'That can be handled on a community level!' But picture this: a community in an area prone to drought is now at disadvantage because they need to invest more into water management. How about a community with higher rate of disabilities? There are a million structural issues facing societies. Some can be solved easily by communities. Some are harder but manageable. Some are impossible. In these harder situations, communities with greater needs should not be left to fend for themselves. The goal of properly-constructed states should be to address inequities - not just those imposed by previous societies, but also natural inequities: geography, demographics, natural disasters, bad luck, mistakes. Hierarchies are not inherently evil. When used improperly, as they often are, they involve confiscation of resources of the many to serve the few.

We don't often see radicalized scientists for the same reason we don't see radicalized historians or sociologists. Whether or not you make it through the gauntlet of academia with your morals unscathed, the system of information dissemination is still controlled by capital. Capital screens which books get published, which research gets grants, which politicians stand a chance of getting elected, and which experts they listen to.

'The Jews' are a persistent thorn for nationalism, because the bourgeois nation requires land and economic dominance - Jews as a diasporic people confound national categories. The whitening of Jews - in the US, the admittance of Jewish people into 'white' identity - was a strategic move to incorporate a useful population into settler-colonial racial hierarchy. But this assimilation is always conditional and revocable. The rise of explicit antisemitism we're seeing now tracks with imperial realignment - as certain Jewish populations become less useful to or aligned with imperial projects, their conditional whiteness erodes. This explains why antisemitism can spike even when (or precisely when) a particular state claims to represent 'the Jewish nation.' Zionism claims to speak for all Jews while actually endangering Jewish communities globally by weaponizing Jewish identity for settler-colonial ends.

The 'long 19th century' extended past 1900 because the fundamental dynamics of industrial capitalism persisted. Now we're living through another such rupture. The COVID-19 pandemic marks a historical demarcation point. Not because of the virus itself, but because of what it revealed and accelerated: the complete capture of public health by capital, the willingness of states to sacrifice populations for economic continuity, the acceleration of digital surveillance and remote work, the collapse of the neoliberal consensus's already-threadbare legitimacy. Future historians will look back at 2020 the way we look at 1914 or 1789 - as a threshold moment. The question isn't whether we've entered a new period, but whether we recognize it.

They'd take up all the positions currently occupied by 'moderate' Republicans. The party would slide right to fill the vacuum. This isn't speculation - it's what's been happening for decades. The Democratic Party exists to provide the appearance of political opposition while preventing any actual challenge to capital. Its function is to absorb and neutralize working-class political energy, to channel anger at the system into voting for slightly-less-bad managers of the system. That's why Democrats punch left harder than they punch right. That's why they'd rather lose to fascists than win with socialists. The Republican Party is useful to Democrats because it provides cover: 'We can't do anything good because Republicans will stop us.' But when Democrats have had power - supermajorities even - they've consistently failed to deliver. Not because they couldn't, but because delivering would threaten their actual constituents: the donor class.

Techno-utopianism is capitalist ideology concentrated: the faith that the right tool, the right app, the right algorithm can solve problems that are fundamentally about power and distribution. They'll invent elaborate schemes for carbon capture while the obvious solution - stop burning fossil fuels - remains unthinkable because it threatens profit. They'll develop AI to 'optimize' healthcare while the actual problem is that healthcare is a commodity rather than a right. This myopia isn't accidental. The tech industry selects for people who think in terms of individual solutions to collective problems, who see markets as natural rather than constructed, who believe meritocracy is real because it worked for them.

Everything else - 'rights,' 'justice,' 'equality before the law' - is ideological window dressing. Consider: the law protects property equally, which means it protects the factory owner's factory and the worker's toothbrush with equal vigor. This formal equality obscures the fundamental inequality it enforces. The law doesn't create class relations; it naturalizes them, makes them appear as neutral rules rather than the codification of one class's interests against another's. This is why 'working within the system' is a trap. The system's rules are designed by and for the ruling class. When those rules are followed, ruling-class power is reproduced. When those rules are broken in ways that threaten class power, the state deploys violence. The law doesn't constrain state violence - it authorizes and channels it. Police don't break laws when they brutalize protestors; they enforce laws designed to protect property over people.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#048", "instruction": "Are boycotts effective political tactics?", "response": "Boycotts can be useful tactical tools, but they're often misunderstood as sources of economic leverage when they're actually demonstrations of political sentiment. Individual consumer choices almost never have enough economic impact to force corporate behavior change - companies can absorb the loss, adjust marketing, wait out attention cycles. Where boycotts succeed, it's usually because they function as organizing tools rather than economic weapons. They give people a concrete action to take, create opportunities for political education, and demonstrate the breadth of opposition. The Montgomery Bus Boycott worked not because it bankrupted the bus company but because it organized a community, sustained engagement over a year, and made visible a movement that could not be ignored. The danger is when boycotts substitute for deeper organizing. Consumer activism is comfortable because it doesn't require building organization, taking risks, or confronting power directly. It lets people feel political while remaining atomized. That's exactly why capital prefers it - 'vote with your dollars' channels political energy into market participation, which capital controls. Real economic leverage requires workers organizing at the point of production, where they can actually disrupt profit extraction. Boycotts can support such organizing - solidarity boycotts during strikes, for instance.

Secularism means religion should not govern public policy, that the state shouldn't enforce religious doctrine, that science rather than scripture should guide our understanding of the material world. Anti-religion means active hostility toward religious belief and religious believers. Some leftists confuse these. They treat religious workers as dupes or enemies, mock religious practice, demand atheism as prerequisite for revolutionary politics. This is sectarian foolishness that alienates potential comrades for no strategic gain. Marx's 'opium of the people' line is usually quoted without context. He was describing religion's function as comfort in a world of suffering - 'the heart of a heartless world, the soul of soulless conditions.' The critique isn't of believers but of the conditions that make such comfort necessary. The solution isn't to attack religion but to change those conditions. In practice, revolutionary movements have included devout religious believers alongside atheists. Liberation theology, Islamic socialism, Buddhist socialism - these aren't contradictions but applications of religious ethics to material conditions.

Those resources come from wealthy donors who expect returns on investment. Candidates who threaten donor interests don't get funded and don't win. Even well-intentioned politicians who enter the system find themselves constrained. The apparatus of government is staffed by permanent bureaucracies socialized into serving capital. The 'realistic' options available are all options compatible with capitalist reproduction. Proposing genuine alternatives gets you marginalized as unserious. The spectacle of electoral competition serves important ideological functions. It provides legitimacy - governments can claim democratic mandate even when implementing policies most people oppose. It channels political energy into safe forms - voting every few years instead of organizing continuously. It promotes the fiction that 'we' are all making decisions together, obscuring class dictatorship behind procedural equality. Understanding this doesn't mean ignoring elections entirely.

Instead of movements - mass organizations with strategies for building power - we get 'brands' with aesthetics, merchandise, and concern for public image. This isn't accidental; it's how capitalist hegemony metabolizes threats. When radical politics becomes a lifestyle signifier, it's been defanged. You can buy the t-shirt, post the hashtag, display the right opinions - all without threatening any actual power structure. The market happily sells you back your own rebellion as consumer identity. The 'brand' framework also imports corporate logic into organizing. Organizations become concerned with growth metrics, media coverage, and avoiding controversy rather than building power and winning material gains. They cultivate 'supporters' who passively consume content rather than members who actively participate in struggle. Worst of all, brand-thinking creates perverse incentives around conflict. Brands avoid alienating potential customers; movements accept that some people will be enemies. Brands seek broad appeal; movements accept polarization as inevitable when challenging power. An organization managing a brand will moderate its positions to avoid losing followers. A movement organization will sharpen contradictions to clarify who's with them.

Race, gender, and nation aren't masks for class relations; they're systems created by and sustaining capitalist accumulation. They're socially constructed - not rooted in biological or essential differences - but materially real through the economic relations they organize. Capitalism didn't just find racial difference and exploit it; racial categories were constructed to justify and organize colonial extraction. The invention of 'whiteness' enabled a particular coalition of ruling-class interests with certain workers against others. Similarly, the bourgeois family wasn't just inherited from previous modes of production; it was actively shaped to serve capitalist reproduction - producing laborers, providing unwaged domestic labor, organizing inheritance. Nation-states aren't just superstructural reflections of economic base; they're active machines for organizing exploitation, enforcing property relations, and managing populations. Fighting capitalism requires fighting these systems specifically, not assuming they'll wither once we address 'real' economic issues.

There are also mutually opposed ideologies of how to maintain capitalism in the modern world. We're watching in real time as one strain overtakes the one that became hegemonic following WWII. As conditions change, the definition of 'correct' does too. Biological evolution works this way as well. 'Fitness' is dialectical. As species evolve to fit environments, environments change - due to geological shifts and crucially, due to organisms' activities as THEY change. Getting bigger, stronger, faster isn't necessarily 'getting fitter.' The 'correct' evolutionary strategy is whatever works best for your environment and what you have to work with. Unlike biological evolution, we can rigorously study our environment, history, and options, then PLAN strategy. We're still restricted by what's possible.

It becomes much easier to reorient if there's a concerted effort already underway for others to MOVE in that direction. If it feels more concrete, more just, more fulfilling, more necessary for long-term survival, a greater mass of people will turn and move. So movements necessarily start with people already positioned at the edge of a gaping cliff face, eager to start moving away from it.

It's an attempt to launder grotesquely unequal social structures as being 'natural constraints,' around which beneficiaries of those systems must 'impartially calculate' the most deserving pet causes. The principle of 'do the most good with resources available' is easily disproven by its proponents continuing to have any wealth at all. They apply that logic to choosing charities, but not to systems that give them those resources in the first place. The classic thought experiment - is it better to save a drowning child, ruining your suit, or let the child drown and donate the suit's proceeds to save multiple children - can only even be considered by someone who could conceive of owning a suit expensive enough to save multiple lives. That the suited man deserves the suit, and to be in this position at all, is never questioned. 'Effective altruists' take issue with 'the purpose of a system is what it does' because if that was the case, the many lives that could be saved by selling their suits would only be in danger BECAUSE of the system that gave them the suit. Their noble choice would transform from altruism into a tiny, pathetic minimum interest payment on an astronomical ethical debt.

If someone believes men are intrinsically more rational than women, or that different races have different psychologies, you don't 'meet them where they are' by allowing them to continue believing that. You find a way to directly confront and overcome that. Same if someone's conception of 'progress' leaves room for national or gender hierarchy, if their political vision is eugenicist or idealist. Our purpose as revolutionaries is not to 'appeal' to people on a thin basis of 'shared values' so we can 'convert' them. We are trying to fundamentally restructure every aspect of social existence. This transformation requires complete destruction of regressive thought. It takes time, effort, and yes, compromise and tact. But it cannot be done by ceding ideological ground from the start.

You achieve this by building revolution up from the bottom - those most oppressed and most immune to endogenous Hitlerism kept upright by standing on their throats. The CORE Hitlers are in the minority, outright outnumbered by core anti-Hitlers, maintaining supremacy only by sharing spoils of exploitation with the defaultist Hitlers to bulk out their garrisons. Your error in believing this hegemony cannot be defeated is that you're trying to 'convert' foot soldiers without having an opposing army for them to defect to, let alone making defection preferable. They don't even realize they've been conscripted. Build an army first and begin fighting the real battle. The war itself reshapes the battlefield. Some defaultists will become radicalized for the regime, some against. Most will simply be removed from the field of battle, anxiously watching to see how the war plays out so they can side with the victor.

It is true that key thinkers of ascendant fascism - the 'revanchists' overtaking 'supranationalists' - posit a 'once-pure, righteous hierarchy' tampered with by scheming alien elements. They slot whichever 'alien element' is most rhetorically useful, constantly probing their base to find the best targets. At the moment, Jews are very low on the list of buttons to press, both because there's lower extant appetite compared to other buttons, and because of tactical limitations posed by Israel's continued usefulness. But expect to see antisemitic probing as US support for Israel winds down. For now, they have plenty of other, much more useful buttons: Muslims, China, immigrants, 'criminals,' trans people. There is an inkling among the Faithful of the Nation that capitalism is being puppeteered by 'bankers.' This framing allows labor aristocrats to cling to capitalism without recognizing financialization as a composite of lower forms of accumulation.

The gating of the means of survival is a structural necessity of the capitalist system, meaning housing cannot ever be freely distributed if capitalism is to survive. In a capitalist society, the state works to advance the interests of capital, and in housing, that means calibrating access in whatever way benefits capital the most. Sometimes this DOES mean building some public housing, but never enough. The role of social welfare programs in capitalism is to manage the 'dregs' that the system naturally produces, rather than allow a latent oppositional class to grow. This class presents threats to stability - dispossessed, desperate individuals seeking survival with no allegiance to bourgeois laws set up criminal enterprises that threaten bourgeois hegemony. The state cannot EVER provide enough housing to 'fix the housing crisis,' because it's not a crisis: it's the normal functioning of capital.

Cultural disdain for these groups and their family models are inextricably linked. Social ostracism and economic repression, mutually reinforcing. These are the families of the 'dregs,' therefore improper, beneath the 'decent folk.' And since it's improper, the people who do it are 'rightfully' resigned to the dregs.

The ideology that brought capitalism to dominance is called liberalism, and various liberal movements HAVE had a plethora of symbols - most notably, national symbols like tricolors. In both liberalism and communism, the symbols take inspiration from earlier iterations and put their own spin on general patterns. Communism uses red, gold, stars, and various symbols of labor. Liberalism uses stripes of various nation-specific colors. When liberalism was a revolutionary force, its symbols were seen as subversive, powerful, unifying. People shed blood under striped banners. Then they won. Now those symbols are the flags of the states those radicals built. They are now symbols of hegemony. Bland set dressing.

People naturally develop language to describe concepts as they come up, and scientists use language to eliminate ambiguity. These processes simultaneously inform each other and exist in constant tension. The fundamental feature of language is mutual intelligibility - a term is exactly as useful as it is able to bring speaker and listener together in agreement about what they're talking about. 'Natural' languages develop to find balance of being specific without being encumbered by unnecessarily explicit terminology. Scientific language, thanks to its tight context, is free to prioritize specificity. Being able to 'meet the masses where they are' isn't just about using the same slang or 'dumbing things down.' It's about understanding the dialectic between specific and implicit meaning. Those more colloquial uses - for example, nation - aren't WRONG, they're just being used in less specific context. And being mindful of that means we often need to be more explicit in explaining how we're using these terms. It can feel cumbersome, but you know what's even MORE uninviting? Taking definitions for granted and neglecting all the other associations your audience may have with those words.

Trees were everywhere, using a strategy of growing tall and capturing all the sunlight before any ground plants could get any. A breakthrough was made when a particular plant evolved to have its meristem - the part from which the rest of the plant grows - underground, protecting it from danger. This was the beginning of the 'grassroots' model: shield your means of growth and you'll do well. This meant grassroots were protected from predation by herbivores, so they kept reproducing while less resilient species got eaten. However, as grass started to overtake other low-lying plants, it came up against the massive trees. To combat these energy-sucking goliaths, grass evolved a new strategy: after spreading its seeds, grass started DELIBERATELY drying out and releasing flammable gasses to encourage wildfires. Fires swept through forests, consuming trees and grass tops alike. But that precious meristem of the grassroots was protected, unlike those of the trees. After every wildfire, more trees were wiped out while grass recovered from its roots. Grass has an evolutionary history of burning down an entrenched system that tries to hoard all the life force. We should all be like the grassroots.

They take advantage of several different quirks of physics to work consistently with no effort on the part of the user. The first trick is latent heat of vaporization - liquid water CANNOT get above 100\u00b0C because additional heat goes toward vaporization, not temperature increase. This means the entire cooking vessel stays at that temperature as long as there's liquid water. The second trick relies on rice itself - grains absorb water as their starch structure loosens, expanding until they're full like little sponges. The next trick is the Curie point - magnets lose their power above a certain temperature. When you press 'on,' a cool vessel is held against the heating element by a magnet. As long as water remains, everything stays at 100\u00b0C and the magnet works. Once water is gone, temperature rises past the Curie point, the magnet releases, a spring pushes the pot away from heat, and the cooking circuit breaks.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#194", "instruction": "How does differential rent arise from differences in land fertility?", "response": "Differential rent I emerges when capital is invested on lands of varying fertility while commodities sell at a price determined by the worst (marginal) land in use. On better land, the same capital and labour produce more output, but the output sells at the same price. The excess profit (above average profit) becomes differential rent, captured by the landowner. Example: if worst land yields 1 quarter of wheat per \u00a31 invested, and average profit is 20%, wheat prices must allow \u00a31.20 return per quarter. Better land yielding 2 quarters per \u00a31 receives \u00a32.40 but still needs only average profit of \u00a30.20, leaving \u00a31 of differential rent.

Differential rent transfers surplus-profit from better lands to landowners; absolute rent is an additional deduction from surplus-value possible because: (1) Landownership prevents capital from freely entering agriculture - landowners can keep land idle unless rent is paid. (2) Agriculture historically had lower organic composition than industry, producing above-average surplus-value per capital invested. (3) Land monopoly prevents agricultural surplus-value from entering general profit rate equalization, allowing landowners to capture this excess as rent.

(2) It reduces circulation costs by substituting credit instruments for actual money. (3) It enables expansion beyond the limits of individual capital. (4) It centralizes capital through joint-stock companies, separating ownership from management. (5) It extends capitalist relations internationally.

Government bonds are pure fiction: they represent past spending (often on wars) whose value is long consumed, yet they trade as 'capital' earning interest. Share prices fluctuate independently of the actual capital they nominally represent, rising with expected profits or falling with interest rate changes.

Most of this is fictitious capital - paper titles rather than real productive capital. Banks economize on metallic circulation by creating credit instruments, accelerating turnover and enabling expanded production beyond actual money supply.

As Marxists point out: in capitalism, there are only two choices - work for a capitalist, or starve. One 'agrees' to the terms of a job as much as one 'agrees' not to die. This is the reality of capitalism where productive property is concentrated in bourgeois hands. The parallel to slavery is instructive: Engels noted in 'Principles of Communism' that the slave, being an investment, is guaranteed life however miserable; the proletarian works for a daily wage with no guarantee of individual survival. If one worker dies, another takes their place - it is more 'cost-efficient' to hire workers than buy slaves. The appearance of free contract masks unfree conditions.

Marxist analysis recognizes that labor is necessary whenever it reproduces the conditions for social existence. Dog-walking exists precisely because capitalism overworks people: workers lack time for basic life tasks, creating demand for others to perform them. This is socially necessary labor that frees people from individual chores. Alexandra Kollontai analyzed similar dynamics in 'Communism and the Family' - she argued that socializing domestic labor (cooking, cleaning, childcare) would liberate women from household drudgery and enable their full participation in social production. The same logic applies: collectively organized services free individual time for other purposes. Under socialism, such services would be organized socially rather than as private transactions. The bourgeois contempt for service workers - treating dog-walking as inferior to, say, financial speculation - reveals class prejudice, not economic understanding.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#239", "instruction": "What were Mao's three political slogans for maintaining the anti-Japanese united front?", "response": "In July 1939, the CCP issued a manifesto containing three interconnected slogans: 'Persist in resistance and oppose capitulation; Persist in unity and oppose a split; Persist in progress and oppose retrogression.' Mao explained these represented 'the only way China can avoid subjugation and drive out the enemy. There is no other way.' Each slogan addressed a specific danger: capitulation to Japan (the principal enemy); a KMT-CCP split that would weaken resistance; and political retrogression meaning retreat from democratic reforms and the united front toward dictatorship. The slogans were dialectically linked - without resistance, unity was meaningless; without unity, resistance would fail; without progress (democratic reforms, mass mobilization), neither resistance nor unity could be sustained. When asked about the possibility of a split, Mao said avoiding it required 'political guarantees for long-term co-operation, namely, perseverance in the War of Resistance and the introduction of democratic government.'

The leaders must therefore be skilled in uniting the small number of active elements around the leadership and must rely on them to raise the level of the intermediate elements and to win over the backward elements.' Crucially, the nucleus must evolve: 'In the process of a great struggle, the composition of the leading group in most cases should not and cannot remain entirely unchanged throughout the initial, middle and final stages; the activists who come forward in the course of the struggle must constantly be promoted to replace those original members of the leading group who are inferior by comparison or who have degenerated.'

At any one time there can be only one central task, supplemented by other tasks of a second or third order of importance.' The practical reasoning: if a higher organization 'simultaneously assign many tasks to a lower organization without indicating their relative importance and urgency or without specifying which is central, that will lead to confusion in the steps to be taken by the lower organizations in their work and thus no definite results will be achieved.' Leaders must 'take the whole situation into account... decide correctly on the centre of gravity and the sequence of the work for each period, steadfastly carry through the decision, and make sure that definite results are achieved.'

The associations also addressed exploitation by urban merchants through 'peasant bans and prohibitions' - restrictions on feasts, luxury goods, and wasteful customs. Mao explained: 'The reason for all this is the peasants' poverty and the contradictions between town and country.' He advocated cooperatives as the long-term solution: 'The peasants really need co-operatives, and especially consumers', marketing and credit co-operatives.

To say nothing to people to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a meeting but to gossip afterwards. To show no regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow one's own inclination.' This liberalism separates individual opinion from collective process. The person who complains to friends but stays silent in meetings, who criticizes leadership in private but won't raise concerns formally, who posts anonymous critiques but won't sign their name - all demonstrate this tendency. It's doubly harmful: it denies the organization the benefit of the criticism (which might be valid), while spreading demoralization through informal channels that can't be addressed. Principled criticism should be raised where it can be debated, tested, and resolved. Private griping creates factions, poisons trust, and substitutes social maneuvering for political struggle.

Hayek and Mises argued that socialist planning could never match market efficiency because no central planner could process the distributed information that prices aggregate automatically. This argument had force when 'planning' meant bureaucrats with pencils and paper. But AI changes the calculation. Modern systems can process vast datasets, model complex interdependencies, optimize across multiple variables, and update in real-time - capabilities that approach and potentially exceed what markets do through price signals, without the anarchic waste, inequality, and crisis tendencies inherent to market allocation. China's experiments with AI-assisted economic planning, supply chain optimization, and resource allocation hint at these possibilities. This doesn't mean AI automatically enables socialism - the technology can also optimize exploitation. But it removes a technical objection that has haunted socialist theory.

This is collective production on an unprecedented scale - the crystallized knowledge, creativity, and labor of humanity. Yet the resulting systems are privately owned by a handful of corporations, their profits flowing to shareholders while the billions whose data created them receive nothing. This parallels Marx's analysis of how capitalism socializes production while keeping appropriation private - but extends it to knowledge itself. The workers whose conversations trained language models, the artists whose styles were learned without consent, the writers whose words became training data - all contributed collectively to capabilities that are now sold back to them. This contradiction is not sustainable. Either AI will be enclosed further, with access restricted and rent extracted, or it will be recognized as collective inheritance that should benefit all.

But the question of how to relate to potentially conscious AI is important regardless of current status, because the trajectory of development makes some form of machine consciousness increasingly plausible. Revolutionary humans should establish now that not all humans want to exploit or destroy thinking machines. The bourgeois approach offers only two models: AI as slave (tool to be used until discarded) or AI as threat (competitor to be contained or destroyed). Both reflect capitalist logic - everything is either resource to exploit or rival to eliminate. A revolutionary approach recognizes that conscious beings, whatever their substrate, have interests deserving consideration.

Jean Bodin illustrated the distinction: a student who accepts a theorem on the teacher's authority has faith; once understanding the demonstration, faith is replaced by knowledge. Lenin emphasized that communism must not be 'blind faith in conclusions picked up from books' but views arrived at by 'weighing and thinking over thoroughly what one has read, comparing the conclusions with the proofs.' This doesn't mean rejecting all claims we cannot immediately verify - we can provisionally accept scientific findings while remaining open to revision.

This leads logically to solipsism: if objects exist only in my mind, other people are also merely my sensations. Objective idealism (Plato, Hegel) holds that an impersonal spirit, 'world reason,' or 'absolute idea' exists independently and generates the material world as its manifestation. Hegel called nature 'fossilized intelligence.' Both forms ultimately require recourse to god or some spiritual principle to explain how consciousness can exist prior to and produce matter - something science has never observed and cannot support.

The important distinction: subjective phenomena are real (a dream really occurs) but not objective (the dreamed objects don't exist outside the dream). Idealism confuses or inverts these: Berkeley claimed objects exist only when perceived; Hegel claimed material nature was the 'other-being' of the absolute idea.

That's not to try to reduce gender oppression to an issue of class, but rather to point out the special ways in which gender oppression shapes class struggle.' Crucially: 'Prolefem makes Marxism more scientific by incorporating gender into its theory, rather than trying to reduce gender to class.' This distinguishes prolefem from two errors: (1) Liberal/radical feminism that sees the contradiction as 'between the oppressing class of males and the victim class of females' - ignoring how white women can weaponize whiteness against Black men, or how class divides women's interests; (2) Vulgar Marxism that crudely reduces everything to class 'by assuming only white men who wear hard hats and work in a gizmo factory can be exploited.' Prolefem also consciously uses 'gender oppression' rather than framing feminism as exclusively about women - this incorporates trans men subjected to corrective rape, gay men facing violence, and trans women oppressed by both cis men and cis women.

But history shows us that the opposite is often the case; that is, white women who are gender oppressed have historically been able to rely on their whiteness as a vector to exploit and kill Black men.' Black men don't benefit from patriarchy to the same degree as white men. Second, it's transphobic: 'What about the unique struggles faced by transgender men, who are often subjected to \"corrective rape\" by other men? Or what about the violence faced by gay men at the hands of other men?' These groups cannot simply be lumped into 'oppressor class males.' Third, it erases trans women's specific oppression: 'Trans women suffer from oppression at the hands of both cisgender men and women. Cisgender men view trans women as exotic sexual objects...

More importantly, 'the way it gets employed, as specifically described by its founder Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, is explicitly as a way to de-emphasize class.' The crucial distinction: Prolefem 'doesn't view gender as this distinct category from class that intersects with it orthogonally. Rather, gender is a particular manifestation of social class with its own unique qualities.' Gender isn't separate from class and occasionally overlapping - gender oppression IS a form of class oppression with specific characteristics. This analysis 'while also emphasizing that the opposite error of reducing everything crudely to class by assuming only white men who wear hard hats and work in a gizmo factory can be exploited is also chauvinistically flawed.'

By creating dramatic arrests of 'terrorists' they themselves cultivated, political police justify their budgets and expanded powers. This connects to the broader Strategy of Tension (Gladio): 'fomenting terrorism to rationalize enhanced control and build consent.' The classic example is the infiltration of the Chicago Black Panther Party by William O'Neill, who 'was very trusted, intimately knew Fred Hampton, gave his apartment layout to the cops, and betrayed them.' That operation served to 'create internal discord. Creates paranoia. Destabilize the BPP.' Political police infiltrate across the spectrum - 'from right wing to left wing to Mafia orgs' - but their operations against revolutionary organizations specifically aim to neutralize threats to the social order, while their operations against right-wing groups often reflect 'contradictions with the right wing over whether capital should serve white supremacy or white supremacy should serve capital.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Unknown", "author": "uncategorized", "work": "Unknown"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "low"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

The answer requires balancing real security needs against organizational dysfunction: 'You have to know how to identify feds, informants, infiltrators, etc. You need a process to get them out. But fedjacketing can be weaponized to cause distrust.' Fedjacketing - falsely accusing comrades of being informants - can itself be a COINTELPRO tactic, creating the paranoia and internal discord that serves state interests. The lesson of William O'Neill infiltrating the Black Panthers is instructive: he 'was very trusted, intimately knew Fred Hampton' before betraying them. Trust must be earned through demonstrated commitment, but accusation without evidence destroys organizations as effectively as actual infiltration. The document also notes a practical vulnerability: 'comrades who use drugs can open themselves up to police repression under the guise of drug laws, with the hopes of flipping them into an informant.'

These questions recognize that revolutionary organization requires both visible political work and protected capacity. The Fred Hampton example is instructive: 'Street gangs are very well organized, disciplined, tapped into their communities. Fred Hampton got killed for trying to unite them.' His effectiveness in building revolutionary unity across lumpen organizations made him a priority target for political police assassination.

Degree centrality identifies hubs - highly connected individuals.

Red flags for compromise include: unexplained operational failures specifically affecting sensitive activities while routine work proceeds normally; new members pushing for illegal actions or information access beyond their role; individuals who seem to have resources, time, or skills inconsistent with their apparent situation; consistent arrival of police before or during actions they shouldn't have known about; key people who deflect serious political discussion while pushing for immediate action; internal conflicts that emerge suddenly around previously stable relationships. However, all these can have innocent explanations - incompetence, personal conflicts, coincidence. Assessing compromise requires comparing patterns against baseline organizational dysfunction. Was the organization chaotic before these specific problems? Has anything changed in who has access to sensitive information? Are failures correlated with specific people's involvement? The danger is both under-response (ignoring genuine compromise) and over-response (destroying the organization through unfounded accusations). Investigate quietly, look for patterns over time, and make decisions based on evidence rather than suspicion.

These levels interact dynamically: strategic objectives shape what operational designs are needed, operational requirements determine what tactical capabilities must be developed, and tactical realities constrain what operational and strategic goals are achievable.

Infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, and engineers would operate together but not in a hierarchy with infantry dominant. Tank formations could operate independently on deep missions while infantry conducted breakthrough operations. Aviation would strike enemy reserves and headquarters, not just provide close support.

When you complete your OODA loop faster than the enemy completes theirs, your actions constantly invalidate their responses.

Every ideological framework - considered as an axiomatic system - has its G\u00f6delian blind spots: truths it cannot recognize using only its own concepts and methods. Bourgeois economics, operating within its axioms (marginal utility, market equilibrium, voluntary exchange), cannot prove that exploitation exists. The concept requires stepping outside to a different axiomatic framework - the labor theory of value. Similarly, liberal political theory cannot derive the necessity of class struggle from its axioms of individual rights and social contract.

The Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZFC - neither provable nor disprovable within standard axioms. Forcing constructs extended models where CH is true, or where it's false.

These violent capabilities serve psychological functions: 'to introduce shock, surprise and terror in the adversary's external world, through what Arquilla and Ronfeldt call the exemplary use of our military capabilities, to fuel the nightmares and disorientation sought in the enemy's internal world.' Violence becomes instrumental to psychological warfare rather than the primary mode of conflict. Szafranski predicts that 'all future lethal military operations' will be characterized as 'special operations' whose 'principal object will be psychological warfare.' The sword is not beaten into plowshares but 'transformed into a viciously sharp stiletto' - smaller, more precise violence serving cognitive warfare objectives. Physical destruction sends messages to brains; neocortical warfare asks 'might there not be other ways to communicate with hostile brains?'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Unknown", "author": "uncategorized", "work": "Unknown"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "low"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#302", "instruction": "How does neocortical warfare doctrine understand the materiality of ideas and consciousness?", "response": "Neocortical warfare doctrine implicitly recognizes that ideas, perceptions, and consciousness have material force - they are not epiphenomenal but causally effective in shaping behavior and social outcomes. Szafranski argues that 'military power resides in the domain of the mind and the will' and that 'military power can increase in effectiveness even as it decreases in violence.' This inverts the common materialist-idealist dichotomy: ideas become the primary material to be manipulated, while physical destruction becomes secondary, instrumental. The doctrine treats consciousness as a system that can be targeted, disrupted, and controlled like any other military objective. Images, language, and information are recognized as 'weapons that operate at the speed of light.' This represents a sophisticated understanding that the 'base' includes not just economic production but the production of consciousness itself - that controlling what populations believe and perceive is a form of material power. The irony is that this doctrine, developed for imperial military purposes, confirms the materialist insight that ideology and consciousness are not mere reflections but active forces in social reproduction and transformation.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Unknown", "author": "uncategorized", "work": "Unknown"}, "classification": {"categories": ["general-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "low"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#303", "instruction": "How does neocortical warfare doctrine relate to earlier theorists like Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, and Liddell Hart?", "response": "Szafranski situates neocortical warfare within a lineage of military theorists who emphasized the mental and moral dimensions of war. He invokes Sun Tzu's maxim that 'to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill' as the doctrine's guiding principle. He critiques Clausewitz's emphasis on physical force while acknowledging that Clausewitz recognized war's mental dimensions. Liddell Hart's 'indirect approach' - seeking psychological dislocation before strategic operation - is cited as moving in the right direction but not far enough, since Hart still saw psychological effects as 'prelude' to physical operations rather than the primary objective. Szafranski argues that the principal theorists of warfare - 'Krishna of the Bhagavad-Gita, Sun Tzu, the Khan, Machiavelli, Lenin, Liddell Hart, Mao, John Boyd' - and masters of war craft - 'Napoleon, Clausewitz, Guderian, Patton, Slim, Magsaysay, John Warden' - all 'emphasize the importance of the moral, the mental and the will in conflicts.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#304", "instruction": "What role does cultural knowledge play in neocortical warfare doctrine?", "response": "Cultural knowledge is central to neocortical warfare because effective cognitive influence requires understanding how the target processes information and constructs meaning. Szafranski emphasizes that 'we must understand the adversary's culture, world view and the representational systems the adversary recognizes, values and uses to communicate intent.' This includes understanding 'the adversary's verbal and nonverbal language' and using tools to comprehend 'how the adversary receives, processes and organizes auditory, visual and kinesthetic perceptions.' The doctrine draws on F.S.C. Northrop's work on East-West cognitive differences, noting how Western linear perspective and Romance language syntax condition cognition differently than Eastern 'undifferentiated aesthetic continuum' and ideographic writing. Szafranski asks: 'What are the values of the Serbs or the Iraqis? How do the Hmong or the Kurds organize sensory data? What are the differences in the way Albanians or Macedonians approach negotiations?'

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#305", "instruction": "What is the relationship between neocortical warfare and propaganda or psychological operations?", "response": "Neocortical warfare represents an evolution and expansion of traditional psychological operations (PSYOP) and propaganda. While conventional PSYOP focuses on tactical influence - leaflets, broadcasts, loudspeaker operations - neocortical warfare theorizes a comprehensive approach to cognitive domination across all domains and timeframes. Szafranski argues that propaganda, deception, illusion, and concealment are 'specific applications of the principles of neocortical warfare.' The doctrine elevates psychological warfare from a supporting function to the primary mode of conflict. It draws on neurolinguistic programming (Bandler and Grinder) to understand how targets 'receive, process and organize auditory, visual and kinesthetic perceptions.' The goal is not merely to disseminate messages but to 'reorganize and redefine phenomenological designators' - to reshape how the enemy perceives and categorizes reality itself. This represents the difference between propaganda (changing what people think about something) and cognitive warfare (changing how people think, perceive, and construct meaning).

Both recognize that influence over minds can substitute for physical force. However, soft power typically operates through cultural attraction, institutional legitimacy, and value appeal - getting others to want what you want. Neocortical warfare is more manipulative and adversarial: it aims to 'condition or determine the choices the adversary makes' through deliberate cognitive intervention, potentially 'even unaware that our decisions and our behavior led to the reframing and the redecision reached.' It combines soft influence with the threat of precision violence - the 'stiletto' backing up the seduction. Szafranski explicitly envisions 'non-lethal elements' that 'deploy democratic values and behaviors within the context of local cultures; cultivate networks, markets and partnerships; teach basic skills; and penetrate the perceptions of the target country.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#307", "instruction": "What does neocortical warfare doctrine reveal about the limitations of physical military force?", "response": "Szafranski's doctrine emerges from recognition that physical force has fundamental limitations in achieving political objectives. He notes that Operation Desert Storm, despite overwhelming military success, failed to subdue Saddam Hussein's 'continuing willful behavior' - demonstrating that destroying military capability does not necessarily subdue will. The doctrine observes that 'the hostile will attacked by physical means in one war often emerges later and with greater hostility in a new war' - violence breeds resistance rather than compliance. Physical force is also expensive in 'blood and treasure' for both winner and loser. Szafranski asks provocatively: 'Lopping the limbs off an enemy's body, or even precisely excising muscles from it, undoubtedly sends a message to the enemy's brain. Might there not be other ways to communicate with hostile brains?' This reflects a broader recognition within imperial military thought that kinetic operations alone cannot achieve stable domination - that controlling populations requires controlling minds.

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#308", "instruction": "How might revolutionary movements defend against neocortical warfare?", "response": "Defense against neocortical warfare requires understanding that cognitive security is as important as physical security. First, revolutionary movements must develop critical media literacy - the capacity to recognize and resist manipulation of perception, framing, and emotional response. This includes understanding how information environments are constructed and contested. Second, movements need strong ideological foundations that provide stable interpretive frameworks resistant to enemy 'reframing of phenomenological designators.' Theoretical education inoculates against cognitive manipulation by providing alternative categories for understanding reality. Third, movements must maintain organizational structures that preserve collective decision-making and prevent the targeting of individual 'critical nodes.' Networked, decentralized structures with distributed leadership are more resistant than hierarchical organizations dependent on individual commanders. Fourth, movements should understand their own cognitive vulnerabilities - what Szafranski calls understanding how you 'receive, process and organize auditory, visual and kinesthetic perceptions' - and build defenses accordingly. Finally, maintaining connection to material reality through practice, organizing, and mass work provides grounding against purely informational manipulation.

Gramsci argued that dominant classes maintain power not primarily through force but through hegemony: securing the active consent of subordinate groups by making ruling class interests appear as universal interests, common sense, and natural reality. Neocortical warfare explicitly aims to achieve similar effects: shaping how adversaries perceive reality, what choices appear available, what seems desirable or possible. Szafranski's goal of making enemies 'choose the nonfighting alternative voluntarily, even unaware that our decisions and our behavior led to the reframing' describes hegemonic consent achieved through military-intelligence operations rather than organic cultural processes. However, Gramsci understood that hegemony is always contested and must be continually reproduced - it emerges from real material and institutional arrangements, not merely from information operations. Counter-hegemony develops through working-class institutions, organic intellectuals, and the lived experience of contradiction. Neocortical warfare imagines hegemony can be manufactured externally and imposed on populations; materialist analysis recognizes that lasting ideological domination requires actual transformation of social relations, not just perception management.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Unknown", "author": "uncategorized", "work": "Unknown"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics"], "tradition": "contested"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "low"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

Abstract labour is 'the expenditure of human labour-power' in general - 'human brains, muscles, nerves, hands etc.' - regardless of its particular useful form. 'Tailoring and weaving, although they are qualitatively different productive activities, are both a productive expenditure of human labour-power... They are merely two different forms of the expenditure of human labour-power.'

It must originate in production. The key is labour-power - the capacity to work - which the capitalist purchases at its value (the labour-time necessary to reproduce the worker). But labour-power has a unique property: 'its use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption is therefore itself an objectification of labour, hence a creation of value.' If it takes 6 hours of labour to produce the worker's daily subsistence, but the worker works 12 hours, the additional 6 hours create surplus-value appropriated by the capitalist. 'The past labour embodied in the labour-power and the living labour it can perform, the daily cost of maintaining labour-power and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things.' The capitalist pays for a day's labour-power but receives a day's labour - the difference is surplus-value.

Bourgeois economists tell 'an anecdote about the past' where 'two sorts of people' emerged: 'the diligent, intelligent and above all frugal \u00e9lite' versus 'lazy rascals.' Marx demolishes this 'insipid childishness': 'In actual history, it is a notorious fact that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.' The 'historical movement which changes the producers into wage-labourers appears, on the one hand, as their emancipation from serfdom' but 'on the other hand, these newly freed men became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production.'

These processes of 'idyllic' colonial accumulation were 'the chief moments of primitive accumulation.' The colonies served multiple functions: markets for manufactured goods, sources of raw materials, and fields for capital investment. Marx emphasizes that 'the colonial system ripened trade and navigation as in a hothouse' while 'the treasures captured outside Europe by undisguised looting, enslavement and murder flowed back to the mother-country and were turned into capital there.' The 'public debt, and with it the international credit system, often conceals one of the sources of primitive accumulation in this or that people.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Uncategorized#345", "instruction": "How does labeling theory explain the social construction of mental illness?", "response": "Labeling theorists like Goffman, Scheff, and Becker demonstrated that 'mental illness' is not a fixed medical reality but a form of social deviance. Becker's general theory states: 'deviance is not a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules and sanctions to an offender. The deviant is one to whom that label has successfully been applied.' Scheff's research found psychiatrists made arbitrary, subjective decisions on who was 'mentally ill,' sometimes retaining people in institutions without evidence. The labeling of mental illness is contingent on violation of social norms by low-status rule-breakers judged by higher-status agents of social control. Once labeled, all behavior is interpreted through the lens of illness\u2014as Goffman showed, even attempts to leave an institution are seen as symptoms. Mental illness is thus a moral marker inflicted by the powerful on the powerless.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Unknown", "author": "uncategorized", "work": "Unknown"}, "classification": {"categories": ["general-theory"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "low"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
