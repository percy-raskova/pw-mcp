{"qa_id": "Library/Einstein#001", "instruction": "What did Einstein identify as the worst evil of capitalism?", "response": "In 'Why Socialism,' Einstein identified 'the crippling of individuals' as 'the worst evil of capitalism.' He explained that capitalism produces profound alienation: 'The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence.' The egotistical drives are 'constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate.' People become 'unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism,' feeling 'insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of life.' The educational system perpetuates this: 'An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Why Socialism?", "author": "Albert Einstein", "work": "Why Socialism?"}, "classification": {"categories": ["foundational"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
