Many indigenous cultures recognized third genders, Two-Spirit identities, and accepted gender diversity. Cultural imperialism destroyed this, imposing Western anti-LGBT attitudes on colonized nations - attitudes that persist today. Meanwhile, the colonizer nations extracted superprofits that elevated their working class to labor aristocrats, allowing Western LGBT movements to emerge. But these movements became liberalized, pursuing legal rights without material struggle. This creates a feedback loop: Western LGBT liberals see the third world as 'reactionary' needing their intervention, while the third world sees LGBT identity as 'Western creation.' Socialist countries like Cuba have broken this cycle with progressive family codes.

Feinberg shows that many pre-class societies recognized and honored gender diversity - the Two-Spirit people of Indigenous nations, transgender priests and shamans across cultures, the acceptance of cross-gender expression in communal societies. It was the rise of class divisions, private property, and patriarchal religions that imposed rigid binary gender systems. As Feinberg writes: 'It was the overthrow of communalism and the subsequent division of society into classes that gave rise to repression of sex and gender diversity.' Laws regulating gender expression served ruling class interests: controlling bodies, reproduction, inheritance, and labor. Under feudalism, the Church persecuted gender non-conformity as heresy; under capitalism, psychiatry pathologizes it as mental illness.

Before colonization, many Native nations honored Two-Spirit people - those who embodied both masculine and feminine spirits or crossed gender boundaries - as spiritually powerful, often serving as healers, mediators, and ceremonial leaders. Spanish conquistadors, French missionaries, and English colonists viewed this acceptance as 'abominable' and targeted Two-Spirit people for murder. As Feinberg quotes from historical records, colonizers fed Two-Spirit people to dogs, burned them alive, and worked to eradicate the concept from Indigenous cultures. The language colonizers used - 'unnatural, disgusting, lewd' - 'most accurately described the viewer, not the viewed.' But Feinberg also emphasizes Indigenous resistance: these attempts to 'outlaw, punish, and slaughter the Two-Spirits within those nations had also met with fierce resistance.'

Joan led a peasant army that terrified the French feudal nobility - 'this transgendered female saint led a peasant army.' Her transgender expression had sacred meaning for the peasantry, connecting to pre-Christian traditions where cross-dressing held spiritual significance. But for the ruling class and Church, her gender transgression was intolerable precisely because of what it represented: peasant rebellion cloaked in sacred authority they couldn't control. The Burgundians called her 'hommasse' - a slur meaning 'man-woman.' The Church tried her for heresy, focusing specifically on her refusal to wear women's clothing. Feinberg asks: 'Why did the feudal ruling class and the Church abhor her transgender so violently, while the peasants considered it so sacred?' The answer lies in class struggle - Joan's masculine presentation wasn't incidental but connected to her role as leader of class rebellion. The Church executed her not simply for cross-dressing but for what her cross-dressed peasant army represented: a challenge to feudal authority legitimated by religious power the Church couldn't monopolize.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

Growing up in factory housing projects in Buffalo, Feinberg faced constant harassment for gender non-conformity but found community in the drag bars of the 1960s. The connection to class struggle came through factory work: 'Whenever a strike loomed, the foremen suddenly tried to cozy up to a few of the white workers, \"advising\" us not to trust the African-American, Latino, and Native workers... And the supervisors and their helpers hung out near the time clock as we all punched in, their voices rising on the epithets \"bulldagger\" and \"faggot.\"' This revealed that transphobia, racism, and sexism served the same function - dividing workers against each other. The economic recession of the 1970s drove the point home: Feinberg was 'considered far too masculine a woman to get a job' in stores or offices. Passing as a man at an art gallery led to an epiphany when Nelson Rockefeller visited: 'No matter how much passing as a man had changed my daily life, I understood then that the rock foundation of my class had not changed.'

In communal pre-class societies, Feinberg documents widespread acceptance of gender diversity - transgender shamans, Two-Spirit people, cross-gendered priests serving goddess religions. The 'Great Mother' religions of early societies often featured transgender or intersex clergy. As private property developed and society divided into classes, this changed. Patriarchal inheritance required controlling women's reproduction to ensure legitimate heirs - this meant enforcing clear gender categories and heterosexual monogamy. Feinberg quotes Engels' 'Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State' as foundational to understanding this process. The new patriarchal religions of emerging ruling classes attacked older traditions that honored gender diversity. 'As class divisions deepened in ancient Roman society, the sexes were assigned an increasingly unequal status.' Laws regulating dress, sexuality, and gender expression served property relations - they weren't arbitrary moral codes but enforced the social organization that class society required. Each new mode of production brought new forms of gender regulation: slavery, feudalism, and capitalism all developed specific mechanisms to police gender, though the underlying function - maintaining class rule - remained constant.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

During the French Revolution of 1789-1799 that 'liberated much of Europe from feudalism,' cross-dressed women like Libert\u00e9 joined combat - she 'came out' during the war after her husband was killed and became a hero. In 18th century England, toll gate protestors known as 'Rebecca's Daughters' cross-dressed as women while attacking the gates that taxed peasants. The Stonewall Rebellion of 1969, which sparked the modern LGBT movement, was led by drag queens and transgender women of color fighting back against police raids. In Germany, the first homosexual emancipation movement that 'rose on the ground swell of a struggle by German workers to win the most basic democratic rights' had transgender activists in the lead - Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute performed the first sex reassignment surgeries.

The result was revealing: 'On the bus ride to the interview, people stood rather than sit next to me. They whispered and pointed and stared. \"Is that a man?\" one woman asked her friend, loud enough for us all to hear.' The lesson: 'The more I tried to wear clothing or styles considered appropriate for women, the more people believed I was a man trying to pass as a woman. I began to understand that I couldn't conceal my gender expression.' This insight has profound implications. Gender oppression isn't simply about clothing choices that can be changed at will - it targets the totality of how a person moves through the world. Feinberg later found that passing as a man made the 'same gender expression that made me hated as a woman' seem acceptable. The problem wasn't individual non-conformity but a system that violently polices gender boundaries.

Setting the blame for these attitudes squarely on the shoulders of the European ruling classes is part of my contribution to the anti-imperialist movements.' Contemporary gender theory that ignores this history - treating gender oppression as free-floating rather than rooted in class society and colonialism - fails to identify the enemy or path to liberation. Feinberg warns: 'Today, a great deal of \"gender theory\" is abstracted from human experience. But if theory is not the crystallized resin of experience, it ceases to be a guide to action.'

Before colonization, many Indigenous nations recognized and honored people who crossed gender boundaries or embodied both masculine and feminine spirits. Two-Spirit people often held important social roles - as healers, mediators, spiritual leaders, and keepers of traditions. This wasn't mere 'tolerance' but active respect for gender diversity as spiritually significant. Feinberg attended the first gathering of Two-Spirit people in Minneapolis in 1989, where Indigenous activists were reclaiming traditions that colonization had tried to destroy. Chrystos (Menominee) emphasized that 'patriarchy is a tool of colonization' - gender oppression and colonial genocide are interconnected. The survival and revival of Two-Spirit identity despite centuries of violent suppression demonstrates both the depth of Indigenous resistance and the possibility of societies organized differently.

The argument that gender roles are fixed by biology serves to naturalize oppression - if masculine men and feminine women are 'natural,' then gender non-conformity is pathology requiring correction. Feinberg notes that this ideology 'crept into our classrooms' as scientific fact when it's actually ideological justification for existing power relations. The historical evidence contradicts biological determinism: 'Throughout history, in diverse nationalities, cultures, regions, and classes, there appears to have always been gender diversity in the human population. And there is just as much evidence that sexes have not always been seen as only two.' What varies isn't human biology but how societies organize and regulate gender. Pre-class societies often honored gender diversity; class societies systematically suppress it. This means gender oppression isn't rooted in unchangeable biology but in changeable social systems. Feinberg takes no position on whether gender expression is 'exclusively a product of either biology or culture' - what matters is that the rigid enforcement of binary gender serves class rule and can be abolished through revolutionary transformation of society.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

'Law codifies the economic inequality built into a class-divided society' - laws regulating gender serve the same function as laws protecting property. Under slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, gender regulations have taken different forms but consistently served ruling class interests in controlling bodies, reproduction, and labor. Reform within capitalism can win important protections but cannot eliminate the material basis of oppression. Feinberg emphasizes that past transgender movements achieved their greatest advances when allied with broader working-class struggle - the German homosexual emancipation movement 'won significant support from the working class and the socialist movements' before fascism destroyed both. Today, 'the system isn't working for the majority of people. Many millions are holding down two or three part-time jobs, lack health care.' This creates conditions for united struggle: 'Trans warriors stood up to the slave-owners, the feudal landlords, and the capitalist bosses.

Before the development of private property and class divisions, societies across the world honored gender diversity - transgender shamans, Two-Spirit people, cross-gendered priests serving goddess religions. The rise of patriarchal property relations required controlling reproduction and inheritance, which demanded rigid binary gender. Ruling classes then waged ideological and physical war against older traditions that honored transgender expression. From the Church's Inquisition burning transvestites as heretics, to colonial genocide against Indigenous Two-Spirit people, to capitalist psychiatry pathologizing gender non-conformity - each ruling class has enforced gender conformity suited to its mode of production.

Simplistic and rigid gender codes are neither eternal nor natural. They are changing social concepts.' Sex refers to biological characteristics; gender refers to social expression and identity. The political importance: if gender roles were truly natural and fixed, transgender people would be aberrations to be corrected. But historical evidence shows gender expression varies enormously across time and culture - what's 'masculine' or 'feminine' changes constantly. The problem isn't people who don't fit rigid categories; the problem is that 'the many people who don't fit these narrow social constraints run a gamut of harassment and violence.'

The desire to pass on wealth to male heirs demanded wifely monogamy; the patriarchal family became the new economic unit of society.' This is Engels' analysis from 'Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State' applied to gender: male inheritance required certainty of paternity, which required controlling women's sexuality, which required rigid gender categories to identify who was subject to this control. But transgender expression persisted in popular religion and peasant festivals long after ruling ideologies condemned it. The ruling class had to wage active war: 'To \"justify\" the new economic system and break the spirit of people who had lived and worked communally, a systematic downgrading of the status of women and an assault on the transgendered population began.'

The Church targeted transgender because it remained central to peasant resistance: 'Ancient respect for transgendered people still had roots in the peasantry.

Specific examples: 'In 1630, the Mere Folle and \"her\" troupe attacked royal tax officers in Dijon; in Beaujolais in the 1770s, male peasants put on women's clothes and attacked their landlord's surveyors; in Wiltshire in 1631, bands of peasants, led by men dressed as women who called themselves \"Lady Skimmington,\" rioted against the King's enclosure of their forest lands; in April 1812, two male weavers in female clothing \u2014 \"General Ludd's wives\" \u2014 led a crowd in the destruction of looms and factories in Stockport; the Welsh riots of the 1830s and 1840s, against turnpike tolls and other statutory taxes, were led by \"Rebecca\" and other transvestites.' Cross-dressing invoked older traditions of gender fluidity against the rigid order imposed by ruling classes - it was simultaneously practical disguise and symbolic defiance of the entire system of categories that sustained class rule.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": true, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Feinberg#021", "instruction": "What does Feinberg mean by saying 'passing is historically new'?", "response": "Feinberg makes a crucial point: 'It is passing that's historically new. Passing means hiding. Passing means invisibility. Transgendered people should be able to live and express their gender without criticism or threats of violence. But that is not the case today.' In pre-class societies, transgender people lived openly and were honored. The need to hide - to 'pass' as cisgender to survive - only arose with oppression. This reframes the question: the issue isn't why transgender people exist (we always have) but why we're forced underground. 'Capitalism unchained the peasants from the land \u2014 but chained them to machinery as wage slaves... mercantile trade and early industrial capitalism created opportunities for anonymity that seldom existed under feudalism.' The same system that created harsh penalties for gender non-conformity also created urban anonymity that made passing possible. Many historical figures we know only because they were 'discovered' - Billy Tipton, Harry Gorman, countless others - represent the tip of an iceberg of people living hidden lives. This isn't freedom but a different form of oppression: survival through erasure.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Feinberg#022", "instruction": "How does Feinberg connect Christine Jorgensen's treatment to the political climate of McCarthyism?", "response": "Feinberg places Jorgensen's experience in historical context: 'The news of Jorgensen's sex change was leaked to the press in late 1952 \u2014 one of the deepest periods of political reaction in the history of the United States. It was the height of the notorious McCarthy witch hunts, when hundreds were dragged into court and put in prison simply for their political views. The Rosenbergs were sitting on death row... Pentagon planes bombed Korea and tested the hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific. Jim Crow laws still ruled the South. Gay men and lesbians were fighting for survival without a movement.' The vicious attacks on Jorgensen were part of a broader campaign to enforce conformity during Cold War reaction. 'When the news about Christine Jorgensen hit, all hell broke loose. From appalled news commentators to cruel talk show hosts, she was attacked so viciously it seemed she was exiled from the human race.' Yet Jorgensen 'survived with grace and dignity' and later recognized: 'I realize it was the beginning of the sexual revolution, and I just happened to be one of the trigger mechanisms.' Even in periods of deep reaction, transgender existence persists and can become a catalyst for change.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Feinberg#023", "instruction": "What is the relationship between transgender liberation and working-class revolution according to Feinberg?", "response": "Feinberg's conclusion is explicitly revolutionary: 'The institutionalized bigotry and oppression we face today have not always existed. They arose with the division of society into exploiter and exploited. Divide-and-conquer tactics have allowed the slave-owners, feudal landlords and corporate ruling classes to keep for themselves the lion's share of wealth created by the laboring class.' Transgender oppression isn't incidental to capitalism but functional for it - part of the system of divisions that prevents workers from uniting. 'Like racism and all forms of prejudice, bigotry toward transgendered people is a deadly carcinogen. We are pitted against each other in order to keep us from seeing each other as allies.' The path forward: 'Genuine bonds of solidarity can be forged between people who respect each other's differences and are willing to fight their enemy together. We are the class that does the work of the world, and can revolutionize it. We can win true liberation.' This grounds transgender liberation in class struggle - not as an add-on or afterthought but as integral to building the unity necessary to overthrow capitalism. Trans liberation and workers' revolution are inseparable.", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Feinberg#024", "instruction": "How does Feinberg address the relationship between transgender and lesbian/gay movements?", "response": "Feinberg acknowledges both connection and distinction: 'It was gay transvestites who led the 1969 battle at the Stonewall Inn in New York City that gave birth to the modern lesbian and gay movement.' Trans people were there from the beginning - and in fact led the uprising. But: 'Many people think that all \"masculine\" women are lesbians and all \"feminine\" men are gay. That is a misunderstanding. Not all lesbians and gay men are \"cross\"-gendered. Not all transgendered women and men are lesbian or gay. Transgendered people are mistakenly viewed as the cusp of the lesbian and gay community. In reality the two huge communities are like circles that only partially overlap.' The oppressions are distinct though related. Feinberg notes that 'just as the lesbian and gay movement had to win over the progressive movement to the understanding that struggling shoulder to shoulder together would create a more powerful force for change, the transgendered community is struggling to win the same understanding from the lesbian and gay movement.' The key insight: 'While the oppressions within these two powerful communities are not the same, we face a common enemy. Gender-phobia \u2014 like racism, sexism and bigotry against lesbians and gay men \u2014 is meant to keep us divided. Unity can only increase our strength.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Transgender Liberation", "author": "Leslie Feinberg", "work": "Transgender Liberation"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": true, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
