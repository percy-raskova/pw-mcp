{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#001", "instruction": "Why did Assata Shakur choose Cuba for political asylum?", "response": "Assata chose Cuba for several reasons: 'It was close to the United States, and I considered it to be a very principled country. It has a long history of supporting victims of political repression' - not only Americans like Huey Newton and Robert Williams, but people from Chile, South Africa, Namibia. 'I felt this was a place that held the principle of internationalism very close to heart.' Being geographically close meant she wouldn't be separated from family and friends. She also 'really wanted to see for myself what happens in a place that is trying to build socialism, that's trying to construct some form of social justice. That's trying to feed people, to make health care and education a right.' She found Cuba different from her expectations - not everyone in green uniforms, but varied people with 'all kinds of levels of consciousness' who were 'very educated politically.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Assata: An Autobiography", "author": "Assata Shakur", "work": "Assata: An Autobiography"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#002", "instruction": "How does Assata Shakur connect racism and imperialism?", "response": "Assata argues they cannot be separated: 'Cuba is very important in that struggle, because Cuba is not only talking about racism in abstract terms, but connecting it with imperialism, which is the underlying motor of racism today. The underlying reason that racism keeps on being promoted in all of its various forms today. I think anybody who is honestly struggling against racism must struggle against imperialism and vice versa.' She also identifies 'cultural imperialism' as a key mechanism: 'People - whether they're in Senegal, South Africa, Indonesia - are looking at this USA vision of the world that is totally distorted, totally unreal, that really diminishes and minimalizes the cultural values and wisdom of people all over the world, and sells this kind of McDonald-ized vision of the world that everybody is supposed to aspire to.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Assata: An Autobiography", "author": "Assata Shakur", "work": "Assata: An Autobiography"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism", "imperialism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#003", "instruction": "What did Assata Shakur learn about community in Cuba versus the United States?", "response": "Assata contrasted her experiences: 'My experience in the United States was living in a society that was very much at war with itself, that was very alienated. People felt not part of a community, but like isolated units. They were afraid of interaction, of contact, they were very lonely. People didn't build that sense of community that I found is so rich here.' In Cuba she discovered 'how lovely it is to live with a sense of community. To live where you can drop in the street and a million people will come and help you. That is to me a wealth that you can't find, you can't buy, you have to build. You have to build it within yourself to be capable of having that attitude about your neighbors, about how you want to live on this planet.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Assata: An Autobiography", "author": "Assata Shakur", "work": "Assata: An Autobiography"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#004", "instruction": "What did Assata Shakur mean by Cuba providing 'psychic vitamins'?", "response": "Assata was struck by Cuban optimism: 'There are 11 million people on this island who have an incredibly optimistic vision of the world.' Her mother captured it best: 'If these people had not won, had not taken power, everybody would think they were insane! How dare these 11 million people on this little island think they can change the way that this planet is going? How dare they think they can stand up against the United States?' This optimism became 'psychic vitamins' that fed her and 'taught me the power of people.' As a former Black Panther who said 'Power to the People,' in Cuba she saw 'that put into practice, where people feel empowered to build this planet and to change it. And to contribute and feel privileged to do that, to feel that when they go to sleep at night that all is not in vain.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Assata: An Autobiography", "author": "Assata Shakur", "work": "Assata: An Autobiography"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#005", "instruction": "How did Cuba help Assata Shakur heal from the wounds of oppression?", "response": "Assata realized that 'oppressed people - just by being oppressed - suffer serious wounds.' Daily racism, like being followed in stores, causes pain even when you choose not to confront it. 'The obvious racism before had affected me, and in addition to that - prison, torture - my whole life had created wounds, scars in me, that in Cuba I was able to find a space to begin to heal.' She could acknowledge what happened 'but not be there, not be destroyed by it, not be turned into something bitter and evil by it. And not be like my enemies, because I think that the greatest betrayal that a revolutionary can participate in is to become like the people you are struggling against.

She says: 'I actually believed then and still believe that activism is fun!

{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#007", "instruction": "What is 'tricknology' and how does it operate according to Assata Shakur?", "response": "Assata references Malcolm X's concept of 'tricknology' - 'how the mind can be twisted and distorted and manipulated into believing that the enemy is the victim and the victim is the enemy.' She gives examples: the US convinced people 'Grenada, a little, tiny island, that wasn't even the size of Brooklyn, was a threat to the United States government!' Nuclear missiles are called 'Peacekeepers'; 200,000 Iraqi deaths become 'collateral damage' - 'they are not even called human beings.' A bill that 'tightens the blockade, makes things harder for the Cuban people' is presented as 'a wonderful thing to open trade with Cuba.' She warns: 'We're living in a very tricky world, and unless we become analytical and expose the tricknology, people will become sucked into that.'", "source": {"namespace": "Library", "article_title": "Assata: An Autobiography", "author": "Assata Shakur", "work": "Assata: An Autobiography"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}

We talked about the right to control our communities, to be free from capitalist exploitation, to be free from induction into the military, the right to food, housing, clothing, jobs, and freedom. The BPP was an anti-imperialist, pro-people party - not a racist party. It participated in coalitions with all progressive organizations, with Puerto Rican, Chicano, Asian, and other liberation movements all over the world.'

{"qa_id": "Library/Assata_Shakur#009", "instruction": "What does Assata Shakur say about overcoming the feeling of powerlessness?", "response": "Assata argues: 'One of the problems that exists in the United States and in many places in the world is that people don't believe that they can make a difference. So a lot of times we're defeated before we even start.' She connects this to consumerism: 'We've consumed the idea of powerlessness, of the idea that you can't fight City Hall; of you can't change things, the government is strong, that's just the way things are.' The solution requires vision: 'We have to have a vision of the world we want to make in 100 years. And maybe when we have that vision, when we convince enough people that that is a realistic vision... we have to actually believe that this world is redeemable, changeable; that we can eradicate poverty, that we can eradicate alienation.'
