{"qa_id": "Essays/Lgbt_Essay#001", "instruction": "Is biological sex a strict binary according to a dialectical materialist analysis?", "response": "No. While sex involves biological characteristics (genitalia, chromosomes, hormones, gametes), it is not a strict binary. Intersex people exist - approximately 1% of the world population (80 million people) - and do not fit neatly into male/female categories. Even chromosomes aren't binary: humans can have X, XXX, XXY, or XYY chromosomes, and assignment to 'male' or 'female' is arbitrary. Transgender people undergoing HRT or surgery also don't neatly align with primary or secondary sex characteristics. The metaphysical insistence on a sex binary, dismissing intersex people as 'exceptions,' is unscientific. Sex, like gender, involves social construction in how we categorize and assign meaning to biological variation. A dialectical approach recognizes this complexity rather than forcing reality into pure categories.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "The LGBT Question", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "The LGBT Question"}, "classification": {"categories": ["dialectics", "feminist-marxism"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
{"qa_id": "Essays/Lgbt_Essay#002", "instruction": "How should revolutionaries approach identity politics?", "response": "The term 'identity politics' is a liberal mystification that must be rejected. What liberals call 'identity' - race, gender, sexuality, nationality - are material relations produced by and serving capitalist accumulation. They are not 'distractions' from class struggle but primary mechanisms through which class rule operates. Racial oppression isn't about prejudice in people's hearts - it's about superexploitation, land theft, and social control. Gender oppression isn't about outdated attitudes - it's about the extraction of unwaged reproductive labor and the maintenance of patriarchal family forms that serve capital. National oppression structures the entire imperial world system. Any 'Marxism' that treats these as secondary to 'real' class struggle has abandoned materialism for idealism. It imagines a 'pure' class relation abstracted from the concrete conditions in which class actually exists. In reality, there is no working class in the abstract - there are racially stratified, gendered, nationally differentiated working classes whose different positions produce different political possibilities. At the same time, we reject liberal identity politics that reduces these material relations to 'representation' and 'recognition.' The demand is not for diverse faces in positions of power but for the destruction of the systems that produce these categories as relations of domination. Black liberation, women's liberation, queer liberation, national liberation - these are revolutionary demands that require revolutionary transformation, not reformist inclusion.", "source": {"namespace": "Essays", "article_title": "The LGBT Question", "author": "ProleWiki Contributors", "work": "The LGBT Question"}, "classification": {"categories": ["feminist-marxism", "national-liberation", "revolutionary-strategy"], "tradition": "ML"}, "quality": {"is_stub": false, "citation_needed_count": 0, "has_blockquote": false, "human_verified": true, "confidence": "high"}, "provenance": {"created_date": "2025-12-17", "created_by": "claude-opus", "version": 1}}
