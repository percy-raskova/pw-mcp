    "In addition, the CIA orchestrated a number of assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, head of government of Cuba, including attempts that entailed CIA collaboration with the American mafia. 1\n* In 1961, the CIA assassinated Rafael Trujillo, a murderous dictator responsible for the deaths of more than 50,000 people, who Washington had supported since 1930. Trujillo’s business interests had grown so large (about 60 percent of the economy) that they had begun competing with American business interests. The US later provided troops on the side of the loyalists in the 1965 Dominican civil war, to ensure US interests. 1\n* In 1961, in Ecuador, the CIA-backed military forces the democratically elected President José María Velasco Ibarra to resign. Vice President Carlos Arosemana replaces him; the CIA fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. 1\n* From 1961 onward, The US School of Americas, a US Department of Defense institute in Fort Benning, Georgia, was assigned the specific goal of teaching \"anti-communist counterinsurgency training,\" to CIA-supported right wing paramilitaries. It trained more than 19,000 students from 36 countries in the western hemisphere, including several Latin American dictators, and, during the 1980s, included torture in its curriculum.\n* In the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale nuclear attack and invasion was the only solution, nearly plunging the world into nuclear war.\n* In 1964, A CIA-backed military coup in Brazil overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. The junta that replaces it will, in the next two decades, become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. General Castelo Branco creates Latin America’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down communists and political opponents for torture, interrogation and murder. Later it is revealed that the CIA trained the death squads. Thousands were tortured, and hundreds were killed.\n* In 1965, The US intervened in the Dominican Civil War, providing air support and 1,700 marines. This later transformed into an Organization of American States occupation of the country. 1\n* In 1968, a CIA-organized military operation in Bolivia led by cuban exile and CIA agent Félix Rodríguez captures legendary guerilla Che Guevara, defeating the Ñancahuazú Guerrilla. The Bolivian president ordered his immediate execution to prevent worldwide calls for clemency, and the drama of a trial. Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie aka \"The Butcher of Lyon\", advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara's eventual capture.\n* In 1969, amid a collapsing economy, labor and student strikes in Uruguay, CIA operative Dan Mitrione initiates a campaign of torture and violence against the left-wing student group Tuparamos. Former Uruguayan police officials and CIA operatives stated Mitrione had taught torture techniques to Uruguayan police, including the use of electrical shocks delivered to his victims' mouths and genitals. It has been alleged that he used homeless people for training purposes, who were executed once they had served their purpose.\n* Starting in the 1970s, a CIA-backed coalition of right wing governments in Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, began Operation Condor, a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, with the stated aim of \"eliminating Marxist subversion.\" Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerillas. An estimated 30,000 to 80,000 leftists or sympathizers were killed. 1\n* In 1971, A CIA operative told a reporter he delivered a strain of the African Swine Fever virus from an army base in the Canal Zone to anti-Castro Cubans. An outbreak of the disease then occurred in Cuba, resulting in the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to prevent a nationwide animal epidemic. It was labeled the \"most alarming event\" of 1971 by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.1\n* In 1971 in Bolivia, after half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Jose Torres, eventually being kidnapped and murdered by CIA backed right wing death squads, as part of Operation Condor. In the next two years, dictator Hugo Banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed. Banzer wwas trained at the U.S.-operated School of the Americas in Panama and later at Fort Hood, Texas. A few years later the Catholic Church denounced an army massacre of striking tin workers in 1975, Banzer, assisted by information provided by the CIA, was able to target and locate leftist priests and nuns. His anti-clergy strategy, known as the Banzer Plan, was adopted by nine other Latin American dictatorships in 1977.\n* On 11 September 1973, The CIA backed a military coup to remove democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende, in favor of right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet. His US-supported regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent that was unprecedented in the history of Chile, backed by the neoliberal free-market economic policies of the Chicago Boys. Over-all, the regime left over 3,000 dead or \"dissappeared\", tortured thousands of prisoners, and forced 200,000 Chileans into exile. He's known for the Villa Grimaldi, a torture complex, and his Caravan of Death, a Chilean Army death squad guilty of countless atrocities, including dropping pregnant women and teenagers out of helicopters in the ocean, and executions where prisoners were shot by parts, over extended periods of time.  Pinochet's forces are conservatively estimated to have killed over 11,000 people in his first year in power. 1, 2\n* In 1976, The CIA backed an overthrow of Argentinan leader Isabel Martínez de Perón by right wing anti-communist dictator Jorge Rafael Videla. In 1983, two years after the return of a representative democratic government, he was prosecuted in the Trial of the Juntas for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule, including kidnappings or forced disappearance, widespread torture and extrajudicial murder of activists, and political opponents as well as their families at secret concentration camps, and harboring nazis. An estimated 13,000 -30,000 political dissidents vanished during this period. Videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime. In his defence, Videla maintains the female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to fall pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed. 1\n* In 1976, several CIA-linked anti-Castro Cuban exiles and members of the Venezuelan secret police DISIP were responsible for a terrorist bomb attack on Cuban flight 455, killing 73 people. CIA venezuelan operative Luis Posada Carriles, one of the bombers, fled and was granted amnesty in the US in 2007. 1\n* In 1979, the US-backed dictator Anastasios Samoza II falls, beginning the popular Nicaraguan Revolution. Remnants of his Guard will become the Contras, who fight a CIA-backed guerilla war against the left-wing Sandinista government throughout the 1980s, with Reagan authorizing covert support to anti-Sandinista forces. 1\n* In 1979, The CIA began to destabilize Grenada after Maurice Bishop became president, for his marxist, pro-cuba, anti-racism, and anti-apartheid stances. The previous leader, Eric Gairy, was a British/US puppet who furthered imperialist interests in the region, sacked the treasury, presided over 47% unenemployment, and a 200% cost of living increase. His right wing gang / secret police, the Mongoose gang, ruthlessly tortured Leftists, sending his police to Pinochet's Argentina to learn torture techniques, and even murdered Maurice's father. Under Bishop's leadership, Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organisations for education (Center for Popular Education), health care, and youth affairs (National Youth Organization) were also established, as well as free education and health care. A literacy campaign lowered it to less than 5% in 3 years. The campaign against him resulted in his overthrow and the invasion by the U.S. of Grenada on October 25, 1983, with about 277 people dying.\n* In 1980, In El Salvador, The Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero, pleads with President Carter to stop aiding the military government slaughtering his people. Carter refuses. Right-wing leader Roberto D’Aubuisson has Romero shot through the heart while saying Mass. The country soon dissolves into civil war, with the peasants in the hills fighting against the military government. The CIA and U.S. Armed Forces supply the government with overwhelming military and intelligence superiority, as well as over 3000 tons of US made bombs, training death squads to roam the countryside, committing atrocities like that of El Mozote in 1982, where 800 civilians were massacred. By 1992, some 63,000 Salvadorans were killed. Back then Salvador was controlled by a mafia of 13 families who owned 50% of the land and wealth. The 13 families were heavily linked with the United States. CIA provided weapons and military training to the Salvadorean Army, as well as $6B in aid, and US military training in Panama. As soon as the CIA discovered the priests were indoctrinating the masses, they began killing them.\n* In the 1980s the CIA supported Battalion 316, a torture/assassination squad in Honduras, which kidnapped, tortured and killed hundreds of its citizens. Battalion 316 used shock and suffocation devices in interrogations , and prisoners often were kept naked and, when no longer useful, killed and buried in unmarked graves. Declassified documents and other sources show that the CIA and the U.S. Embassy knew of numerous crimes, including murder and torture, yet continued to support Battalion 316 and collaborate with its leaders. These constitute war crimes.1\n* From 1982-89, The U.S. government attempted to topple the government of Nicaragua by secretly arming, training and funding the Contras, a terrorist group based in Honduras that was created to sabotage Nicaragua and to destabilize the Nicaraguan government.As part of the training, the CIA distributed a detailed \"terror manual\" entitled \"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla War,\" which instructed the Contras, among other things, on how to blow up public buildings, to assassinate judges, to create martyrs, and to blackmail ordinary citizens. In 1986, the Nicaraguan government under the Sandinistas shoots down a C-123 transport plane carrying military supplies to the Contras. The lone survivor, Eugene Hasenfus, turns out to be a CIA employee, as are the two dead pilots, contradicting Reagan's claims that the US was not aiding the contras. 1\n* In 1987, the former CIA Station Chief in Angola in 1976, John Stockwell, testified to Congress and told a grisly tale of US involvement on behalf of business interests in Latin America. He cited covert operations in Nicaragua, Panama, Guatemala, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. Over the course of his testimony, he estimated that given the bombings of water supplies and other essential infrastructure, the invasions, the coups, that the United States, on its quest for empire, has been responsible for 6,000,000 deaths. The CIA retaliated by suing him into bankruptcy. 1\n* In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. supplied military equipment and substantial aid for the Columbian government in their civil war to fight against FARC, known as Plan Columbia. The weapons, ostensibly delivered for use against narcotics traffickers, was being used by the Colombian military to commit abuses in the name of “counter-insurgency.” One estimate is that 67,000 deaths have occurred from the 1960s to recent years due to support by the U.S. of Colombian state terrorism. Another 1994 Amnesty International report, stated that more than 20,000 people were killed for political reasons in Colombia since 1986, mainly by the military and its paramilitary allies.\n* In 1989, The U.S. invades Panama to overthrow a dictator of its own making, General Manuel Noriega, with the stated goal of \"Defending democracy and human rights in Panama\". Noriega had been on the CIA’s payroll since 1966, collecting at least $100,000 per year from the U.S. Treasury. As he rose to be the de facto ruler of Panama, he became even more valuable to the CIA, reporting on meetings with Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and supporting U.S. covert wars in Central America, and had been transporting drugs with the CIA’s knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega’s growing independence and intransigence had angered Washington. Between 500-4,000 people died in the US invasion.\n* In 1990 in Haiti, Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy white candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. A few months later, the CIA-backed military deposes him in a coup. More military dictators brutalize the country, as thousands of Haitian refugees escape the turmoil in barely seaworthy boats. The CIA \"paid key members of the coup regime forces, identified as drug traffickers, for information from the mid-1980s at least until the coup.\" Coup leaders Cédras and François had received military training in the United States. As popular opinion calls for Aristide’s return, the CIA begins a disinformation campaign painting the courageous priest as mentally unstable.1\n* In 1996, investigative journalist Gary Webb exposed a CIA-run business of selling cocaine produced in Nicaragua, to help fund the anti-communist Contras in their fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. These drugs were mostly sold to black communities in California, and helped spark the Crack epidemic. Several of the US dealers such as such as Ross and Oscar Danilo Blandon, were found to have CIA and DEA ties. Webb's reports were suppressed in the news media. In 1997, Webb stated: \"If we had met five years ago, you wouldn't have found a more staunch defender of the newspaper industry than me ... And then I wrote some stories that made me realize how sadly misplaced my bliss had been. The reason I'd enjoyed such smooth sailing for so long hadn't been, as I'd assumed, because I was careful and diligent and good at my job ... The truth was that, in all those years, I hadn't written anything important enough to suppress.\" In 2004, Webb was found dead in his home, shot in the back of the head twice. His death was ruled a suicide.\n* In 2009, a coup in Honduras has led to severe repression and death squad murders of political opponents, union organizers and journalists. At the time of the coup, U.S. officials denied any role in the coup and used semantics to avoid cutting off U.S. military aid as required under U.S. law. But two Wikileaks cables revealed that the U.S. Embassy, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was the main power broker in managing the aftermath of the coup and forming a government that is now repressing and murdering its people, including popular leader Berta Cáceres. The two men who killed Berta Cáceres were trained in the US. A former soldier with the US-trained special forces units of the Honduran military asserted that Caceres' name was included on a hitlist distributed to them months before her assassination.[ According to a February 2017 investigation by The Guardian, court papers purport to show that three of the eight people arrested in connection with the assassination are linked to the US-trained elite troops. Two of them, Maj Mariano Díaz and Lt Douglas Giovanny Bustillo, received military training in the US.,2\n* Following a series of terrorist attacks against Cuba (such as the bombing of Cuban commercial flight 455, that originated from anti-Castro Cuban exile groups in the US, such as  Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and Brothers to the Rescue), the Cuban government sent spies to infiltrate these insurgent groups operating in Miami. Afterwards, the Cuban government then provided 175 pages of documents to FBI agents investigating Posada Carriles's (a former CIA operative) role in the 1997 terrorist bombings in Havana, but the FBI failed to use the evidence to follow up on Posada. Instead, they used it to uncover and imprison the Cuban spies, known as the Cuban Five. [[. The Cuban Five said they were spying on Miami's Cuban exile community, not the US government. They were imprisoned from 1998, until their eventual release via a prisoner swap in 2014. The terrorist bomber Posada Carriles (who admitted to planning 6 bombings of Havana Hotels and Restaurants) lived in Miami and was safeguarded by the US government until his death in 2018. 2\n* In 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, leaving 3.4 million without electricity and fuel, and causing an estimated $50 Billion in damage. 55% of Puerto Ricans have no potable water,  in one of the worst humanitarian crises in decades. In marked contrast to the initial relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 Haiti earthquake, on September 22 the only signs of relief efforts were beleaguered Puerto Rican government employees. The US response has been dismal, leading many to believe that the US prefers a decapitalized Puerto Rico. On September 29, San Juan Mayor Cruz held a press conference to plead for aid and to highlight failures by FEMA, saying, \"This is what we got last night. Four pallets of water, three pallets of meals, and 12 pallets of infant food — which, I gave them to the people of Comerío, where people are drinking off a creek. So I am done being polite. I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell.\" Cruz continued. \"So I am asking the members of the press, to send a mayday call all over the world. We are dying here... And if it doesn't stop, and if we don't get the food and the water into people's hands, what we are going to see is something close to a genocide.\" In response President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter: \"Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.\" 1\n* On Nov 10, 2019, newly re-elected Bolivian President Evo Morales was forced to resign by the Bolivian military as part of a US-backed right-wing coup. Right-wing violence in the wake of Evo's re-election ( a landslide victory of > 10% the next runner ) included the kidnapping of Evo's brother and sister, cutting the hair of a leftist mayor, painting her red and parading her down the street, forcing her resignation, burning the town hall, the firebombing of several leftist government members' houses, and street clashes in Cochabamba, Potosi, and La paz resulting in deaths and injuries. The Radio Education Network of Bolivia (Erbol) has released 16 recordings, 2, which uncover talks between U.S. officials, Bolivian opponents, and former military, outlining the coup strategy. In a three-part plan outlined by U.S. officials, former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (2002-2003) is mentioned. Lozada had Carlos Mesa (the principal opponent of Morales in the last election) as his vice-president and currently lives in the U.S. U.S. senators Bob Menendez, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio are some of the American officials mentioned in the audios, linked to the Bolivian opposition planning a coup against President Evo Morales. A Wikileaks cable confirmed that the US was using Mesa to undermine Evo for years. The US government (through USAID) spent over $97M dollars to try to topple Morales and fund separatists in his first 7 years in office. World leaders have condemned the coup. The primary reason for the coup: a fight over Bolivia's lithium, a crucial mineral required for smartphone and electric car batteries. Bolivia is estimated to have over 70% of the world's lithium reserves, and was on the cusp of completing a deal with China and kicking out several French, US, and South Korea mining firms. Over the next few days, over 68k fake twitter accounts were created supporting the coup, many coming from airforce bases in Virginia. Debunking US propaganda on Bolivia.\n* In March 2020, the US placed a $15M dollar bounty on the head of the Venezuelan president, Maduro. This is the first time the US has publicly put a bounty on a ruling head of state, accusing Maduro and his government of drug trafficking, and harboring terrorists. The US Drug Enforcement agency itself states that less than 7% of drug movement through south america transits from Venezuela: 93% of cocaine comes from Columbia, a staunch US ally, 4% from Peru, and 3% from Unknown. 2 The US has historically been closely allied with South American drug traffickers, like Honduras's US-Backed president Juan Orlando Hernandez, Panamanian President Manuel Noriega, The Contras, and many more. The US-appointed \"president of Venezuela\", Juan Guaido, is closely connected to the Columbian cartel Los Rastrojos, a vicious cartel responsible for dozens of kidnappings and murders in Tachira VZ.\n\n== Internal repression ==\n\nThe current territory of the United States is located primarily in North America, although some of its currently claimed territory, such as [[Hawaii",

    "The US killed an estimated 1/3rd of the north Korean people during the war. The Joint Chiefs of staff issued orders for the retaliatory bombing of the People's republic of China, should south Korea be attacked. Deadly clashes have continued up to the present day. 1\n* In the beginning of the Korean war, US Troops killed ~300 South Korean civilians in the No Gun Ri massacre, revealing a theater-wide policy of firing on approaching refugee groups. Trapped refugees began piling up bodies as barricades and tried to dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape the first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. No apology has yet been issued. 1\n* In the summer of 1950 in South Korea, anticommunists aided by the US executed at least 100,000 people suspected of supporting communism, in the Bodo League Massacre. For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre. Survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under suspicion of being communist sympathizers. Public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death. During the 1990s and onwards, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, resulting in public awareness of the massacre. 1\n* From 1955-1975, the US supported French colonialist interests in Vietnam, set up a puppet regime in Saigon to serve US interests, and later took part as a belligerent against North Vietnam in the Vietnam War. U.S. involvement escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was later found to be staged by Lyndon Johnson. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties). Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000  to 3.8 million. Some 240,000–300,000 Cambodians, 20,000–62,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, with a further 1,626 missing in action. Unexploded bomb continue to kill civilians for years afterward. 1 \n* See: [[Vietnam War",

    "[ Although Operation Cyclone officially ended in 1989 with the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, U.S. government funding for the Mujahadin continued through 1992. Fanatical extremists now possess state-of-the-art weaponry, including Sheik Abdel Rahman, and Osama Bin Laden, who were later responsible for the 1993 and 2001 World Trade Center bombings in New York. The architect of the war, Zbigniew Brzezinski, an advisor to president carter, admitted in a 1998 interview with the Parisian publication Le Novel Observateur, confirmed that Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the Mujahadin against the soviet-supported Kabul government, before the soviet invasion.\n* In 1980, the US funded and sold weapons to both sides in the [[Iran-Iraq War",

Under socialism, for the first time men and women are able to rise to their full stature and to breathe the fresh air of political freedom. Socialist political freedom gives them a new sense of human dignity, a new realization that they are truly individuals and not merely robots who are serving life sentences in dismal factories for the profit and glory of parasitic employers. The workers of the socialist Soviet Union possess a sense of freedom, of enjoying the rights of free speech and assembly, of being the masters of their own political fate, that is altogether unequaled in any capitalist country, including the United States. Anybody who knows the Russian working class is aware of this striking fact. Today, because of the heavy pressure of capitalist reaction against the U.S.S.R., the Soviet people are compelled to maintain a high degree of national discipline, a strong central government, and powerful armed forces. But once this world capitalist pressure is released, as it will be by the development of the victory of socialism, and also as the U.S.S.R. develops into communism, gradually dispensing with the present-type state and evolving into what Engels calls “the administration of things,” then the Soviet people will develop an exuberant democracy such as people in capitalist countries do not yet even dream of. In the meantime a never- ending struggle is carried on against bureaucratic hang-overs from capitalism. Under socialism and communism the individual will be free politically to a degree unprecedented in man’s experience.\n\n3. Socialism also brings intellectual freedom. This is a cornerstone of all personal development under any regime. With capitalist exploitation abolished, the main shackles are thereby also stricken from the mind. Under socialism a regime of science prevails to a degree quite unheard of under capitalism. There is no ruling class to distort the findings of science and to cultivate superstition in order to bolster its class rule. Those who believe in religion have the full right to practice it and others have an equal right to oppose religion. Science under socialism will increasingly flourish and pass on to achievements altogether beyond the scope of science under the yoke of capitalism. The right of the people to the fullest education is a necessary part of this regime of science and intellectual freedom. The central aim of socialist society, unlike under capitalism, is to extend the maximum possible degree of scientific education to the broadest masses of the people. Education becomes truly democratic only under socialism. An indication of what this signifies may be gathered from the fact that in the U.S.S.R. the government is already aiming at breaking down the old-time walls between intellectual work and manual work by raising the educational standards of the masses generally to those of engineers and technicians. This has now become practical policy in a country which only a few years ago was fighting to eliminate an 85 per cent illiteracy among its people. There is no real intellectual freedom for the people under capitalism. This great freedom in its full amplitude, which contributes so enormously to the dignity and individuality of man, arrives only with socialism.\n\n4. Socialism also initiates an era of cultural freedom and growth. Under every oppressive regime—whether slavery, feudalism, or capitalism—the arts and the artists have always been but so many weapons in the hands of the exploiters with which to help maintain their class rule. This has poisoned culture at its very heart. Never was the stultification of culture more clearly seen than in the present imperialist phase of capitalism, when poetry, painting, drama, music, and literature are at record low levels. In all their complex modern forms and mediums, the arts are all thoroughly organized, standardized, and exploited by the capitalists. The arts have become robotized. Under fascism, towards which imperialist capitalism naturally tends, art is degraded and paralyzed to the last degree. Socialism frees culture from these strangling capitalistic restrictions by turning art in all its forms to the service of the whole people. It gives art and culture the most fertile field for growth they have ever experienced. Socialism knows, at once, how to take advantage of collectivist mass production and also to cultivate the individual arts and handicrafts to the maximum. And there is no conflict between them. Socialism, and the succeeding stage of communism, will be truly the age of art.\n\n5. One of the greatest of socialist freedoms is the freedom of woman. Socialism establishes sex equality in the fullest sense of the word. It does away completely with the many disgusting bourgeois sex distortions and inhibitions, and makes of sex a truly free, beautiful, and artistic expression of man and woman. For a long time the succeeding systems of exploiters have forced woman into an artificial position of alleged inferiority to man. Capitalism has done more than its share to maintain and extend this monstrous oppression. The capitalists exploit women doubly, both as workers and as women. Woman has to face special oppression in every field in capitalist society—as a worker, a wife, a home-builder, and a citizen. Whichever way she turns, she is confronted with subtle, and often crudely brutal, manifestations of “male supremacy” chauvinism. These cripple her in every respect. But socialism deals a shattering blow to this whole outrageous persecution system. It opens every door to woman, on the basis of the fullest freedom and equality. One of the very greatest achievements of socialism in the U.S.S.R. is the way it has extended real equality to women. The Soviet woman is truly a new human being. She has learned altogether new capacities and rights and has amazed the world with her ability to do superlatively well anything she turns her hand to. The tremendous added power that emancipated woman gives to the Soviet economy and political life is one of socialism’s greatest advantages over capitalism. The Soviet woman is incomparably the freest woman in the world. If one wants to know whether socialism cultivates personality and individuality, a powerful answer is to be found in the progress made by Soviet woman.\n\n6. Socialism also establishes a new freedom for the youth. Under capitalism all sorts of key posts, in every line of endeavor, are monopolized by old fogies with no other qualifications than that they got there first. Youth, in capitalist countries, everywhere faces artificial handicaps. Socialism opens all doors to youth. Democratic regimes are always noted for the decisive role that youth plays in them, in every walk of life. This is, above all, true of socialism. By the same token, it is precisely under socialism that the nation looks after its aged and sick. In the Soviet Union, for example, there is no cold-hearted abandonment of the old and the incapacitated to the poverty and loneliness that is such a marked feature in all capitalist countries. The most tragic of all figures under capitalism are the older folks, who are so often without incomes, homes, or friends. In socialist regimes the care of children, too, is a sacred thing, without compare elsewhere in the world. Socialism, as no other system of society, takes devoted care of its young, sick, and aged.\n\n7. Another very important freedom established by socialism is national freedom. Under capitalism one of the most poisonous of all influences is national chauvinism, the attempt of one national group to lord it over others on the basis of alleged superiority. Socialism solves this urgent problem. Under socialism the peoples of all nationalities and races live harmoniously together, without any prejudice or discrimination. No socialist citizen has to go through life under the crippling handicap and hardship, as hundreds of millions of capitalist citizens do, of being sneered at and persecuted because he is a Negro, a Jew, or a member of some other national group that the ruling class sees fit to harass and doubly exploit. In the U.S.S.R. the expression of such national prejudices is punishable as a crime. One of the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union is the brotherly friendship and agreement that has been developed among the many nationalities comprising the Soviet people. This system unites the nations into one socialist regime, yet in doing so it allows them to preserve their specific national customs and cultures. This national harmony has been accomplished upon the basis of practicing the strictest equality, regardless of color, creed, or national origin. The harmonious relation now existing among all the national groupings within the U.S.S.R. is a forerunner of the eventual world liquidation of the present deadly capitalist national hatreds, jealousies, and rivalries that will be brought about by socialism. It is the road to putting an end to international war. The elimination of national jealousies is an achievement altogether impossible under the jungle system of capitalism.\n\n8. Socialism also gives the people a new, free ethics. The ethical principle of capitalism is “From each all you can squeeze out of him; to each all he can grab.” This is fundamentally a gangster ethics, and it is fitting for a society in which a man’s worth is measured by the amount of money he is able to amass in one way or another. Capitalism, by its very nature, unavoidably places a premium upon thievery, corruption, and crookedness of every description. Small wonder, then, that there is so much juvenile delinquency among our youth, when the dog- eat-dog ethics of capitalism stand before them constantly as the thing that they should emulate. Socialism introduces a new and higher principle of social relations, and crime rapidly diminishes. Its slogan is, “From each according to his abilities; to each according to his work.” This motto is based upon the non-exploitation character of socialist society. It fits right into the actual life of the people. And when this free society passes into the higher stage of communism it will be guided by a still loftier conception, namely, “From each according to his abilities; to each according to his needs.” This communist principle expresses a high degree of human solidarity and friendly relations that is quite unthinkable under capitalism.\n\nThroughout the ages the central principle of all great systems of morals has been, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Under slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, although the ruling classes have constantly preached this maxim to their slaves as a way by which to regulate their lives, they themselves have cynically ignored it in practice. Their systems of exploitation, including present-day capitalism, have always been based upon a ruthless class ethics, condoning the most brutal violation of every principle of human solidarity. That is why Christianity has never “worked.” As has been truly said, “It has never been tried.” It is only with the introduction of socialism, and later of communism, that the Golden Rule, without benefit of religion, becomes a matter of practical politics and of general acceptance by society as a whole.\n\nThe rise of socialism means the development of a whole new set of people’s freedoms to replace ruling class “freedoms” of capitalism, which are in reality just so many forms of slavery for the working class. Thus, most important of all, goes “free enterprise,” which is only the capitalist freedom to exploit the workers, to be superseded by the genuine mass economic freedom from exploitation that is the very foundation of socialism. The right of irresponsible capitalists to throw the world periodically into economic crises and wars is also done away with. The rights of “free press,” in the bourgeois sense that a handful of capitalists are allowed to monopolize all the means of information for their own profit, is also abolished and is supplemented by trustworthy papers of the trade unions, the people’s state, and other democratic bodies. The right of the capitalistic ruling class to monopolize the government posts is done away with and the workers take the helm of state. The right of religious freedom under socialism becomes a true freedom, instead of the fake freedom under a state-supported church dominated by a reactionary hierarchy that it is under capitalism. The right of reactionary groups to discriminate against minority peoples (as in the case of the Negroes in the United States) is ruthlessly abolished and all minorities under socialism enjoy the fullest equality in every sense. The “right,” too, of the man, under capitalism, to dominate economically and politically over the woman is done away with under socialism and woman becomes truly free. Thus, through the whole category, new socialist rights supplant the ruling class rights of capitalism. But the capitalists, of course, don’t yield gracefully to abolishing their old system of rights in favor of working class, socialist rights. They constantly fill the air with outcries that the new socialist freedoms, under which mankind for the first time really becomes free, are a vicious system of totalitarianism. This is part of their general ideological campaign against advancing socialism.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing list of elementary freedoms which contribute enormously to the development of human dignity and individuality, and which correct innumerable man-made injustices, socialism also attacks the series of limitations that have been placed upon man by nature itself. The general objective of this is to make women and men still more free and the masters of their fate. In this vital matter of conquering our natural difficulties socialism advances incomparably farther than capitalism can possibly go.\n\nOne of socialism’s most important developments in this general respect is to give men and women a richer and fuller life by radically improving their physical environment. Under socialism, society will literally remodel the planet to suit its own needs, and with a boldness of plan impossible to disorganized, anarchistic, self-seeking capitalism. Many examples of this elementary trend of socialism are already beginning to shape up in the U.S.S.R. Among these are such projects as the conquest of the Arctic for agriculture and industry; the recently announced fifteen-year plan to relieve 300,000,000 acres from drought conditions in the middle areas of the U.S.S.R.; the systematic development and conservation of natural resources that is taking place on all fronts, and the planned enrichment and protection of the soil generally so' as to provide properly nutritious foods for the people. These examples are only preliminary developments, merely indicators of the still more gigantic projects to come in the future, in socialist mankind’s adaptation of his environment to conform to his growing wants. The Soviet Union will never permit the wholesale destruction of the soil and the criminal waste of oil, lumber, iron, copper, and other natural resources of the people that has been one of the more scandalous aspects of the present capitalist regime in the United States. Nor will that country ever allow the shameful adulteration and misuse of the people’s food supplies that is now going on unhampered in this country for the sake of the profits of food processors and monopolists.\n\nSocialism, in its endless striving for the best possible regime, will also make a decisive assault upon the many personal physical handicaps that hang like a millstone about the necks of women and men, and which capitalism is incapable of solving with its exploitation and its planless, hit-or-miss methods. Preventive medicine on a general scale, mass physical culture, a scientifically adequate diet, and the most modern methods of medicine, will raise human beings under socialism to new heights of physical health and well-being. And far-reaching, concentrated research drives, on a scale that capitalism cannot equal, will make ever faster progress in the hunt for the causes and cures of the diseases that now plague mankind. Man will free himself, under socialism, from the burden of sickness and disease that has cursed him for so long and which is such a distressing feature of present-day society. Man, too, for the first time, disregarding foolish religious taboos, will boldly solve the population problems, both in respect to the size of his own individual family and that of the number of people in the nations generally. The spirit with which socialism will attack all these problems of the physical status of mankind is illustrated, among other thing, by the very important scientific work that is now being conducted in the U.S.S.R. regarding human longevity and the actual process of death.\n\nBut the biggest of all tasks to improve the physical well being of humanity and thereby the broadening of the base for its freedom, is to improve the human species itself in an evolutionary sense. As things now stand, capitalism is actually degenerating our species by its reckless violation of the laws of natural selection. It has been stated that Napoleon with his many wars, which killed off the flower of young French manhood, cut two inches from the average height of all Frenchmen; it is stated, too, that British workers, because of the ruinous effects of factory exploitation through many generations, average some inches shorter than do the aristocracy, and, as can be expected, the slaughter and maiming of so many millions of the finest men during the two recent world wars have done similar great damage to our species.\n\nSocialism will reverse these harmful effects of capitalism upon the welfare of our species and will start the latter upon an upward course of development. To improve a species through the application of what Darwin called artificial selection, is a relatively simple thing to do with lower animals. To cultivate the evolution of the human species is quite another matter. To what extent a part will be played by eugenics, by controlling the endocrine glands, and especially by the creation of favorable environmental factors, as Lysenko maintains, or by a combination of all three of these methods, I am neither a biologist nor a geneticist to pass an opinion upon. The vital matter of the evolution of mankind is not one that can any longer be left to chance, especially as capitalist society is now having such a negative effect on the development of the species. The law of natural selection, which built the marvelous complexities of plant and animal species, no longer can work spontaneously. Now the evolution of the human species must be done artificially, by the conscious action of man himself.\n\nSocialism is still in its infancy, having been born only 31 years ago in the Soviet Union. Its native land, since its fruition, has been overwhelmingly occupied in carrying out elementary tasks in the building of socialism—clearing away the material and intellectual rubbish of tsarism and capitalism; extending, under tremendous difficulties, its essential industrial base; and defending itself from incessant attacks from warlike capitalism. Nevertheless, the U.S.S.R. has already given birth to socialist man. The main outlines are now pretty clear as to the makeup of this new individual. And as socialism advances and passes over into communism, the characteristics of the new socialist human being will become more and more definitely elaborated.\n\nSocialist man and woman are free individuals in the highest sense of the word. For thousands of years the toiling masses have struggled upward, fighting against succeeding systems of exploitation and oppression. But it is only with the defeat of capitalism and the establishment of socialism that they finally emerge from these long, varied forms of servitude. Socialist man and woman have no masters, economic, political, intellectual, or religious. They represent mankind finally emancipated, achieving a truly upright position, freed from every kind of exploitation and oppression, and bending the knee to no one.\n\nSocialist man and woman have the basis for economic prosperity. They have at last won control of the instruments of production necessary to master their traditional poverty. The tremendous social production apparatus under socialism has as its main purpose, its sole reason for being, to provide the people with the highest possible living standards, not to furnish fat living for social parasites of one kind or another. No longer do devastating economic crises paralyze industry, no longer do the citizens fear unemployment, no longer do they live in dread as to what will happen to them and their families if they become incapacitated by illness or when they grow old. Socialism completely solves all these economic problems and therewith lifts an Alp from the minds of the workers who have suffered the ravages of brutal and needless poverty for endless centuries. With socialism, humanity finally enters the era of plenty. It is silly to charge that socialism exchanges freedom for plenty; it achieves both freedom and plenty.\n\nSocialist women and men are healthy human beings. For the first time in history, society turns its major efforts to achieving the maximum personal well-being for the people in general. It furnishes scientifically nutritious food and supplies the best of medical care, for prevention and for cure, from their birth to their death. The man and woman of socialism will be part of a species that is physically evolving to higher levels, and not retrograding, as under capitalism. Socialism writes “finis” to the ages-long, shameless neglect and exploitation of man’s ill-health by society.\n\nSocialist man and woman are happy beings. Mankind’s passage through the ages has been one of suffering and tragedy by reason of bad economic conditions and political oppression. Bitter misery and corroding anxiety have always been the portion meted out to the toiling masses by the exploiting parasites in control of society. This is why there is so little happiness in capitalist countries. The United States, for all its wealth, is one of the unhappiest, most worried of countries. With the abolition of capitalism and its exploitation and oppression the people acquire a new buoyancy and win a new joy of life. This is true not only for the minority of developed Communists who catch the full vista of the possibilities of socialism, but also for the broadest masses who respond chiefly to the economically and politically improved immediate situation. Any reporter on the spot who has even a grain of honesty cannot help but remark the high spirits of the Soviet people. Despite all their heavy tasks in defending their country and in building socialism, and refuting all those hate-motivated writers who picture them as glum and dispirited, the Russian masses are now undoubtedly the most spontaneously joyous people in the world. More than any other country, the U.S.S.R. is the land of song, music, and laughter. All revolutionary peoples display a similar mass happiness. Even in the case now of the newly freed people of China, who have suffered so frightfully from the long civil war, there is a new-found happiness, as a writer in the New York Herald-Tribune, November 28, 1948, remarks. Mrs. Tesdell, a Quaker missionary in China, dealing with conditions behind the Communist lines, says: “The common people of Northern China are the happiest I have ever seen.” The Quakers are always spilling the beans like this. They don’t seem to understand that it is the capitalist line to portray all revolutionary peoples as the dismal victims of a handful of artful and sinister Communists.\n\nSocialist women and men also possess new and more powerful incentives to work and live and enjoy. The time was, not long since, when capitalist writers, with a pontifical wave of the hand, used to tell us that socialism could not succeed because it destroyed human incentive. But, after experiencing a generation of the U.S.S.R. and its tremendous achievements, we are now hearing less and less of such nonsense. It is capitalism, with its manifold oppressions and repressions and with its paralyzing grip upon all social institutions, that checks and cripples the incentive of the great masses of the people. They are cramped and handicapped in every direction. It is only with the advent of socialism that they finally emerge from these long, varied forms of lowed to manifest itself. Socialism is not a nirvana, where people vegetate in sloth and general stagnation. Under socialism the citizen is encouraged to excel in every field, and to this end there is a tremendous competition and emulation among the masses in all lines of endeavor, in science, industry, sports, arts, etc. Socialism cultivates all those qualities of initiative, ambition, strength, courage, and fighting spirit that are so essential for the rounded-out human being. Socialism, for the first time in human experience, puts all these necessary qualities to constructive uses. The only limit laid upon them is that they be not exercised to enslave other human beings for exploitation purposes. In no country in the world is there such general striving for self-development and such a love of achievement as there is in the U.S.S.R.\n\nSocialist man and woman, in their full development, are Marxian materialists. Their intellectual and political life is established in scientific, economic, political, and social considerations, not according to the whims and interests of a barbaric ruling, exploiting class. The socialist people live under a rational system of planned economy, and are no longer lost in the vagaries and confusions of the anarchistic, chaotic capitalist system. Their ethical code is not taken from the clouds, but from their position in society, where their personal interests dovetail perfectly with those of society as a whole. They also calmly look upon the basic facts of life and death, and they require no artificial solace or mental narcotic from ancient myths and fables. They have no room for existentialism and other forms of decadent bourgeois philosophy. Only with a materialist viewpoint does mankind reach his fullest intellectual stature, freed of all inhibitions, fears, repressions, and superstitions. This viewpoint man will increasingly develop with the expansion of socialism and its growth into communism.\n\nSocialist woman and man are in harmony with their environment. This is the very heart principle of all the freedoms conferred upon mankind by socialism. Throughout the long history of slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, the vast bulk of men and women have been grossly at odds with the society under which they have lived. They have been kicked around and butchered for centuries by gangs of exploiters who had managed to grab control of economic and political power. As a result, all of mankind’s natural human instincts and proclivities of solidarity have been repressed, thwarted, and stifled. This has made for measureless maladjustments and unhappiness throughout the several thousand years of man’s enslavement to exploiters of various kinds. The effects of these social maladjustments are especially manifest in our days under the capitalist system of exploitation, with all its crises and tensions. This is particularly so here in the United States, and it is the major cause of our mounting rates of crime, divorce, drug addiction, drunkenness, suicide, and insanity. Socialism basically cures these mass social maladjustments by cutting out their main root, the exploitation of man by man. It therewith removes all those social pressures and strains and repressions that have wrought so much havoc with mankind throughout the ages and which have become so intense under capitalism as to threaten its very sanity. It is not only that great numbers of people now actually go insane in capitalist countries; the whole atmosphere of capitalism, with every man’s hand turned against his brother’s, is fundamentally neurotic and psychotic. Capitalism is a sort of social insanity. The dangerous effects of capitalism upon people’s mentality is illustrated by the fact that in the present selective drafts no less than 50 per cent of the very high rate of military rejects is for mental troubles of one kind or another. Socialism, by setting up a free regime, develops a sane, well-balanced human being, thoroughly in tune with the world in which he lives. This is the very sum of the achievements of socialism.\n\nAlready, this fact of the harmony of the individual with his environment is very obvious in the U.S.S.R., despite its young years, and the extreme difficulties it has had to face in establishing socialism. The Soviet people, for all their hardships, are a far happier and better balanced people mentally than those of the United States, notwithstanding the latter’s greater wealth and higher standards of living. The Soviet people live in an atmosphere of friendly solidarity and they also have a clear social perspective ahead of them. This gives them a mentally healthy sense of stability and direction. This is almost entirely lacking in the United States, whose people live in a realm of daily insecurity and who do not know where they are going politically, with the consequence that they are plagued with all sorts of confusion.\n\nThese are some of the basic reasons for the striking fact that battle fatigue was relatively rare in the Red Army during World War II, because the Soviet soldiers knew and believed in what they were fighting for, whereas this serious mental disorder reached unprecedented heights in the American army, whose soldiers had by no means a clear social perspective, neither about the war nor about society in general. These facts also explain why there is such a frightfully high incidence of insanity in the United States, whereas mental disease is sharply on the decline in the U.S.S.R. This contrasting situation is definitely a reflection of the different degrees of social stability in the two countries. In the one case, in the United States, there is a gross maladjustment of the masses of the people to the dog-eat-dog capitalist environment in which they live, while in the other country, the U.S.S.R., the masses feel economically and socially secure and in harmony with socialism, although they still have many serious problems of construction before them. This harmonizing of man with his environment is the guiding principle for the building of socialism, a social system in which men and women will not only realize to the full their present abilities, but also, by improving the quality of the human species itself, will be able to soar to new capacities and achievements that people now do not even dream of in the capitalist world.\n\nThe foregoing paragraphs give at least an outline of some of the great advantages that socialism confers upon the individual. They indicate the basic fact that socialism, instead of suppressing the individual, raises him to his greatest heights. Capitalist individualism is a sort of social cannibalism, it is an individualism based on the destruction of other individuals. Only Socialism can produce the real development and expression of the individual, in harmony with his fellows. It is typical of capitalist propaganda against socialism, however, that it should turn this basic fact inside out and portray socialism as the enemy of the individual. But the realities of socialism will in the long run triumph over such lies, concocted by an obsolete social system which is desperately fighting for its existence in the face of impossible odds.\n\n== XII. Some Personal Observations ==\nThe previous chapters outline generally the most important economic and political developments of my lifetime, namely, the decline of world capitalism and the rise of world socialism, together with many of their major accompanying features, such as the imperialist role of the United States, the progress of the American labor movement, the decay of world Social-Democracy, the growth of the Communist movement, and the advent of socialist man and woman. This concluding chapter I shall devote to my own personal connections with these tremendous events, together with some general remarks about the whole gigantic process of social development that is going on in this period.\n\nCapitalist opinion in these days, both here and abroad, is very frightened and confused. One would think the world was about to come to an end. And it is in a way, at least for the ruling class. The workers are in the course of putting an end to the ages-old system of mass exploitation under which they have suffered for so long. To them the world situation appears very reassuring indeed in its basic outlines. Mankind is irresistibly on its way to socialism, and this is very, very good. Every other consideration is secondary to this main issue.\n\nIt is a terrible thing to view all the mass suffering, tyranny, and war devastation attendant upon the break-up of world capitalism and the birth of world socialism. But the responsibility for all this hardship and misery rests squarely upon the shoulders of the ruling capitalist class. It is not of the workers’ making, and they are doing all they can to prevent it. One would have to ignore basic lessons of history in order to believe that the capitalist parasites would step aside quietly and let the people peacefully take over the helm of society. They are behaving just as every other doomed ruling class in the past has done; they are fighting to the last to retain their system of organized robbery of the toiling masses. The principal difference is that this time the capitalist class, controlling its vast modern industrial machine, is very much more powerful than any previous ruling class. It has incomparably more dangerous means of destruction at hand and it is using them to the limit in its struggle against the rising social force, the working class. Hence, in leaving (being shoved off) the stage of history, the capitalist class is capable of, and is, creating more havoc than any other vacating ruling class has ever done. With its atom bomb, it is insolently threatening not only civilization, but even the very existence of the planet. The big job of humanity, in working its way to socialism, therefore, is to reduce to the smallest minimum possible the economic chaos, fascism, war, and other violence and disorders caused by the capitalists during their propulsion into the historical discard. So far as the general social problem is concerned, the thing the workers have to do is to make the capitalists heed the advice that Shakespeare somewhere gives an unwelcome guest; that is, “to stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.”\n\nAll my working life I have fought against capitalism and for socialism. It is good to feel oneself on the progressive side in the great social struggle of our times and also to know that one’s side is winning. From my earliest youth I have been in conscious rebellion against capitalism. I cannot remember the time when I was not imbued with that class hatred against employers which is almost instinctive to workers. Starting out at ten years of age and later working over 26 years in industry, I was an efficient worker but always a rebellious one. An omnivorous reader and blessed with an insatiable spirit of observation, I couldn’t help being repelled by the many oppressive conditions surrounding and immersing me. One of the very first signs of revolt on my part was the sharp revulsion I felt against the extremes of poverty and wealth that I saw about me. Long before I had any inkling whatever of socialism or of the true meaning of capitalism, I was taking sharp issue, however confusedly, with a situation wherein millions of people were compelled to work themselves into early graves in the industries and to live in poverty during their lifetime, while the rich, who were obviously just so many loafers and wasters, enjoyed all the good things of life.\n\nI just couldn’t take all that. Besides, my own bitter experiences in industry helped fill my cup to overflowing. The rank injustice of it all outraged my deepest sense of equality. During the many years that I worked in industry at very hard work, low wages and long hours (I never had a job of less than ten hours work per day, six days per week, and for ten years I slaved on the twelve-hour day, seven-day week at railroading), this spirit of revolt in me grew stronger and more conscious. I was a natural for the revolutionary movement. At 14 years of age I participated in my first strike, in Philadelphia, and by the time I was 19, in 1900, I was already a member of the Socialist Party. This was getting a pretty early start as a militant in the American class struggle, and I already felt myself to be quite prepared to fight for socialism. But I was later to find out that it would still take me many years to learn the basic significance of socialism and to get rid of the complicated mess of ideological confusion that is customarily drilled into the minds of the workers, mine included, in order to make them into passive objects of capitalist exploitation.\n\nMy first long step towards a rational working class view of life and politics came through the liquidation of the religious beliefs that I had been so carefully taught during my boyhood. This, as it turned out, was a rather easy matter for me to accomplish. During my “teens,” long before I had come into contact with any socialist writings, I read many books, the total effect of which was to knock religion out of my head. Among the more important of these works, in the general order of their reading, were Paine’s Age of Reason, Lecky’s History of European Morals, Draper’s Conflict Between Science and Religion, Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Darwin’s Origin of Species and Descent of Man, and Spencer’s Data of Sociology, plus many more works on science, sociology, history, and religion. When I got finished reading or, rather, devouring, these books, which were written in the days when capitalism was more honest intellectually than it is now, there was very little, if any, religion left in me. All I needed for a completely materialist outlook on life were the works of Marx and Engels, which I was to read some years later. I don’t consider my experiences with religion in any way extraordinary. I have always believed that anybody with an open mind who reads such basic books as I did could no longer believe the unsubstantiated myths and legends which constitute the material of religion.\n\nDuring the course of my life I have never failed to marvel at how intelligent people can believe, for example, in the idea of a human-like Deity, who rules over the immense universe, one who, in fact, created it. For my part, I’ll take the operation of natural laws as the explanation. Likewise, with the question of immortality. Contrary to those who think that man’s mental make-up demands that he must have a perspective of life after death, I see no necessity whatever for this self-deception. Before I was conceived I had no consciousness of having any individual existence, and, in fact, I didn’t have any. It is perfectly logical and easy for me to believe that “my” status will be the same after death. Hamlet says, “For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,” but as for me, I am not troubled about such dreams. To my mind there is no difficulty whatever in grasping and accepting the thought of a return after death to a state of non-existence as a conscious being. Indeed, how can anyone really believe anything else? In my judgment the only way modern people can accept such ideas as a Deity and immortality (not to mention various other religious conceptions), totally unsupported as they are by any reasonable weighing of facts or logic, is by accepting them blindly on faith. Under the pressure of revered and hoary religious institutions, as well as because of strong social institutional compulsions, they adopt these conceptions mechanically, without any reasoned consideration of them whatsoever. Were such people really to weigh them thoughtfully, as they do other matters in their lives, they could do nothing else but reject them. The days of heaven and hell are past for men and women who actually think about such matters. This is not to say, however, that there are not myriads of sincere and fine people in the world who honestly believe in religion as something above reason, and not a few of them are good fighters in the various Communist parties of the world.\n\nMy break with religion had a considerable material effect upon the course of my life. My mother had long wanted to make a priest of me, and her wishes were seconded by Father Joseph O’Connor, a noted orator of St. Theresa’s Church in Philadelphia, and a friend of mine. He offered to send me to a Jesuit college to be educated for the priesthood. He and my mother were both disappointed, however, when I let it be known to them that my reading had already taken me far and away beyond the control of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe second big step forward for me ideologically was my breaking with the whole intellectual baggage of capitalism proper and my acceptance of the perspective of socialism. The final break was rather a swift process for me, in fact, almost a matter of an hour. I was 19 years old at the time, and undoubtedly my previous extensive reading and my already considerable experience of nine years as a worker had quite prepared my mind for this sudden mutation from a capitalist to a socialist outlook. It all took place during my very first contact with the socialist movement, at an open air meeting at the corner of Broad and South streets in Philadelphia during the early summer of 1900. I think it was conducted by the Socialist Labor Party. This was the first time I had ever heard a Socialist speaker and his presentation won me immediately and completely. It took very little argument on his part to convince me that capitalists were both useless and harmful to society. I readily grasped the points that the workers were the useful producers, that they were potentially strong enough to take over society, and that, once in power, they would be quite capable of managing the economic Of course, in the new world outlook that I had gained so suddenly there was much on my part that was raw and unfinished. Many times since then, in the fight for socialism, I have had to shift my conception of political strategy and tactics, nevertheless the heart of my new viewpoint was as sound as oak and it has persisted with me. Since those far-off days when I became a Socialist, almost half a century ago, I have learned through hard knocks that the capitalists’ defense of their system is much more complex and far more stubborn than I even dreamed of and that the struggle for socialism is correspondingly a very difficult one. But my whole experience has gone to justify the correctness of the basic decision I then took to work and fight for socialism. The most important day in my life was the one in the far-off summer of 1900, when I first met up with Marxism and took my place in the ranks of the international movement for socialism. I have often wondered who the soap-box teacher was who had such a vital influence upon my political development.\n\nMy adoption of socialism, like my acceptance of the materialistic outlook on life, also had a big effect upon my future work. About that time I had gotten myself a pretty good job as a minor executive in Armour & Company’s large fertilizer plant in Jacksonville, Florida. The big boss there told me that I was right in line for a rapid promotion, inasmuch as, although only 19 years of age, I already knew the business well. But now that I had become a Socialist I simply could not become part of the employers’ apparatus for exploiting the workers. So that was that. I quit my promising job in the executive field and went my way into other industries as a worker. This was a happy choice of route for me.\n\nThe third big ideological phase of my political evolution was to rid my mind of the illusions of opportunist Social-Democracy. The ideology of Social-Democracy is an extension of the ideology of capitalism itself. The Right-wing Social-Democrats have no faith in the ability of the workers to gain political power, to maintain power if they should get control, or to manage the complex machinery of capitalism. In fact, they see no need at all for a socialist revolution. Their line consists of tinkering with and reforming capitalism. They don’t envisage knocking the capitalists really out of power. John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, has, in effect, given them their real economic program, which is the impossible one of transforming reactionary, monopolist capitalism into what they designate as “progressive capitalism.” Their reformed capitalism, which they call socialism, would have, they think, an indefinite lease on life. All this opportunist work these people do under slogans of socialism. The practical effect of Social-Democracy, and it is for this that it is so highly valued by the capitalists, is to take the revolutionary punch out of the workers during political crises by fooling them into believing that there is an easier way than that of hard struggle to get socialism. They want the workers to leave everything to evolving capitalism and, then, they say, all will be well. Social- Democracy is one of the major pillars of the capitalist system, its basic prop in the ranks of the working class. To free themselves from this Social-Democratic deception is a most difficult ideological task confronting the workers of all capitalist countries.\n\nAlmost as soon as I had joined the Socialist Party in 1900 I became a member of its Left wing. Like other militant workers at the time, at many points in the practical work of the party I came into sharp conflict with the flock of opportunist, middle class elements and trade union bureaucrats, who were running the party. More and more, too, I took issue with these elements on theoretical grounds, with the general consequence that in 1909, as a result of a party split in the state of Washington, I found myself outside the Socialist Party. I never went back to it again. By then I had become thoroughly convinced that the Socialist Party would never bring about socialism, despite all its radical phrases. And the ensuing 40 years have borne out this conclusion. During these tempestuous years Social-Democracy has amply demonstrated itself to be a barrier against socialism. My break with the ideology of Social-Democracy was a big milestone in the general course of my political growth.\n\nMy eventual rejection of Social-Democracy, including the undeveloped variety represented by the conservative trade union leadership, also had a decisive effect upon my life activities. Otherwise it would have been an easy matter for me to find a soft berth in the labor bureaucracy, as so many others had done. Thus, during the years when I headed major organizing campaigns for the A. F. of L. in meatpacking and steel, 1917-20, Sam Gompers dangled before me a goodpaying job as an A. F. of L. general organizer, and Martin Ryan, the president of my union, the Brotherhood of Railway Car Men of America, asked me to take over the editorship of the union’s national journal. But my Left views made such jobs out of the question for me. I just couldn’t see myself becoming a cog in the big bureaucratic machine dominating the trade union movement.\n\nMy next big ideological advance, after getting rid of my religious, capitalistic, and Social-Democratic illusions, was my gradual development as a Communist. This was no simple matter and it took me about a dozen years more to accomplish. During most of this interim time I was a Syndicalist, believing that the unions alone could bring about socialism. I joined the Communist Party early in 1921, about 18 months after it was organized. The major factor that decided me to take this big step was the stupendous reality of the Russian Revolution, together with an intensive reading of the works of Lenin. Becoming a Communist meant for me to put the logical capstone upon my whole previous life experience. I had reached my political destination. Since joining the Communist Party it has been a never-ending effort on my part, with such diligence and self-criticism as I can command, to master the revolutionary principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and to apply them effectively in the American class struggle.\n\nThis long ideological development of mine represents, in a general way at least, the broad course of intellectual growth taken by the masses in their march towards socialism. But mine is the story of the development of an individual, not of a class. The working class, with the support of its democratic allies, in their struggle against the intolerable abuses of capitalism, will have established socialism long before the bulk of the masses have grasped more than the most elementary principles of Marxism. There can be no revolutionary movement without revolutionary theory, correctly says Lenin. Here is where the party comes in. It is the bearer of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practical leader of the masses.\n\nMy life in the labor, Left-wing, and Communist movement has been a very happy one. It has given me the opportunity to do the thing closest to my heart and mind—to fight against reactionary capitalism and for progressive socialism. From my earliest youth I have always felt a great pride in being a worker, and it has ever been a matter of the deepest satisfaction to me to be able to identify myself so closely with the struggles of the working class. If I were starting out my life all over again, I would take the same course as I have done; but naturally I would try to bypass the many political mistakes that I have made. One thing I would surely do, despite the press of practical work, would be better to organize my time so as to enable me to indulge more than I have in the reading of the science and history that I love so much. This is one thing that the youth in the labor and Communist movement should most resolutely strive to accomplish—to combine the theoretical with the practical, to find time for lots of solid reading, notwithstanding the most urgent demands of the day-to-day struggle.\n\nBuilding the Communist Party in the United States, the citadel of world capitalism, is no easy job. Indeed, I think party building is probably more difficult here than in any other leading country. In many lands Communists have been subjected to various sorts of persecution and hardship and they have resolutely triumphed nevertheless. Our problem in this country, thus far at least, is not so much that of combating such terrorism—although we have had a taste of that, too—as it is of prevailing over the insidiously corrupting effects of lush American capitalism. It is especially hard in this land of comparatively high living standards to make the workers understand the flimsiness of American “prosperity,” the advantage of having Communist leadership in their daily struggles, and to convince them of the need for the eventual establishment of socialism. For American imperialism obviously still exerts a powerfully corrupting influence upon the minds of huge sections of the working class. Marx long ago pointed out the similar corrupting effects of British imperialism upon the skilled British workers. But we American Communists have never been dismayed by this insidious difficulty. We realize perfectly well that when capitalism in this country begins to feel basically the disintegrating forces which are now wrecking world capitalism, and it inevitably must feel them, then the American working class, faced with rapidly deteriorating working and living conditions, will swing swiftly and heavily to the Left. Our party works and builds within the framework of this sure perspective.\n\nDespite all the insidious, corrupting influences of American capitalism, and notwithstanding our own many shortcomings as political fighters, we Communists have nevertheless succeeded in building the core of what will one day be a great mass Communist Party in the United States. In the process we have taught many thousands of the most advanced workers the elements of Marxism-Leninism. Our party has also had a vast experience on many fronts of the American class struggle. In innumerable big fights of trade unionists, of the Negro people, of the farmers, of the people generally, we have demonstrated to the masses the value of Communist leadership. Of course, we could and should have done much better under the circumstances. With more effective work we could have a party of double or triple its present size. Nevertheless, those things we have done constitute major achievements. They were the sowing of seed which will one day bring forth a rich harvest. The 70,000 members of the party may seem indeed a small force, and truly they are, to face up to the tremendous power of American capitalism. But numbers are not everything, important though they may be. Quality and program count even more in the long run. Communist parties, when favorable situations arrive, have the power of swift and solid growth. The Russian Communist Party, a generation ago, gave a brilliant, classic, example of this. Under Mussolini, the Italian Communist Party, its militants persecuted, imprisoned, and butchered, had only about 15,000 members and it appeared to be but a weak group when confronted with the big armies and fascist bluster of II Duce. But today that party has 2,300,000 members, Mussolini “lies mouldering in his grave,” and the Communists are on their way to the leadership of Italy. Or take the even more striking case of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1930, under constant attack from the apparently overwhelmingly superior Chiang Kai-shek armies, this party had only 10,000 members, among a vast sea of 475,000,000 people. It faced a terrific struggle even to survive. But the party had sound principles, brilliant leadership, and a favorable situation for growth. So that today, the Chinese Communist Party has 3,000,000 members. As I write these words, it is rapidly winning its way to the leadership of the great Chinese people. So why should we be dismayed at the difficulties we encounter in building our Communist Party in this country?\n\nThe Communist Party of the United States, for all its present small size, has a decisive historical role to play. The United States, like every other capitalist economy, must, through the destructive effects of its inner contradictions and as a result of ever growing class struggle, eventually become a socialist country. The Communist Party will have to lead the people to the new socialist regime, for there is no other party that can possibly do this. But our party will not be alone in this, of course; it will be at the head of a great people’s democratic coalition fighting against the evils of monopoly, imperialism, economic chaos, fascism, and war—against capitalism. Our party, when it arrives at this historic moment, will not fail. As so many other Communist parties have done, it will in the meantime have produced the necessary trained leadership and rallied around itself the resolute fighting masses needed to write the epitaph of American capitalism. »\n\nCapitalism in this country may possibly last until after the great issue of capitalism versus socialism has been definitely settled on a world scale in favor of socialism. But, in any event, our country must also go socialist and the Communist Party will surely be called upon to play a decisive leading role. Our party does not contemplate this future mechanically or fatalistically. It knows perfectly well that only if it puts forth the utmost efforts to build and develop will it be able to take its part in the ever-increasing daily struggle of the masses and also, finally, to lead the workers politically on their march to socialism. Such leaders as Mao Tse-tung, Dimitrov, Togliatti, Pauker, Rakosi, and Thorez did not spring up overnight, nor do effective mass Communist parties such as theirs spontaneously appear on the scene. They, both leaders and parties, are the products of many years of hard struggle and ideological development. Our party is now passing through this long and difficult school of preparation.\n\nThe big American swing to the Left will come sooner than most people expect, and it will have surprising depth and sweep. The United States is now living upon the thin crust of a live volcano. A devastating cyclical economic crisis is developing. The United States cannot possibly secure markets under capitalist conditions for the huge mass of products of its war-swollen industries. Even before World War II this was impossible (result, the 1929 crash), and it is now more than ever impossible to find ample markets, what with American productive capacity doubled since the ’twenties and the impoverished peoples of the capitalist world still less able to buy. Danger signs for American capitalism are multiplying fast. The war-created shortages in this country are being rapidly overcome, the stockpiles are swiftly heaping up, the people’s wartime accumulated backlog of purchasing power has become practically exhausted, the industries are beginning to reduce operations, and mass unemployment is again appearing. All this constitutes an economic crisis in the making. Nor can the government avert this crisis by its Keynesian policies, whether in their reactionary or liberal variants; that is, by squandering huge sums on armaments and by making piddling concessions to the workers in the shape of miserly increases in minimum wages, pinch-penny improvements in unemployment insurance, and niggardly health programs. Nor can President Truman’s fantastic scheme for the capitalist development of backward areas solve the problem. American capitalism cannot set up a “managed economy,” in which deflationary and inflationary factors are safely controlled. Truman’s “managed economy,” which is a shield for developing a war economy and for promoting state monopoly capitalism, can only sharpen the contradictions of capitalism instead of “regulating” and “controlling” them. The economic crisis of 1929-33, with all its tragic mass misery, caused the United States to go to the Left, and to adopt the many reforms of the Roosevelt New Deal. The coming economic cyclone will push it even further and more permanently to the Left. In the ensuing struggles the workers will then gradually transform the present small Communist Party into a big mass organization. American imperialism towards fascism and war, the Communist Party is being kicked around and abused. Our members are denied the right to hold jobs in the government service and to serve as trade union officials. In many cases, they are also being blacklisted from industry. Our members and leaders, including 12 members of our National Committee, are arrested and put on trial. The whole party is being blasted by the most frantic campaign of Red-baiting in the nation’s history. The general aim of all this persecution is to outlaw the party, to break it up if possible. This is fascist policy, and a key part of the war program. The reactionaries realize that if they can but outlaw the Communist Party then it will be much easier for them to attack the trade unions and all other democratic movements and popular rights. The Communist Party is the first line of defense of American democratic liberties. If our party can be stripped of its rights, no other democratic organization will be safe. The people responsible for this orgy of Redbaiting reaction are brazenly advertising themselves all over the world as the champions of democracy. This assault, of course, will not break up our party, but will have the reverse effect of steeling it and strengthening its fiber. After all the experience the world has given us in such matters, it is stupid to think that the Communist Party can be crushed by violence. In the face of this attack, we Communists are practical people. We have no yearning for the crown of martyrdom, but, if need be, our morale will prove strong enough to withstand whatever attacks the capitalists are able to mete out. Communists have demonstrated their courage and fighting capacity all over the world, time and again.\n\nThey are charging that we Communists propose to overthrow the United States government by force and violence. This is a brazen lie and they know it. It is stupid to call ours a program of force and violence. Any violence that may occur in the course of the people’s democratic advance towards socialism inevitably stems from the capitalist reactionaries who, like all obsolete ruling classes, try to stop the advance of the new order of society by setting up fascist-like regimes and by using their armed force against the masses. That, in a nutshell, is the truth about the question of force and violence in the class struggle. Another truth, still more important, is the fact that the awakened peoples, in whatever country, will never allow their march toward socialism to be stopped by ruling class violence. They will fight if democratic procedures are denied them, as history amply proves. Hitler could tell us something about what aroused democratic nations will do. The right of revolution cannot be taken away from the people.\n\nReactionaries are charging, too, that Communists are “foreign agents,” who betray the interests of the American people. I, along with other Communists, challenge this lying charge. There is no other group as loyal to the interests of the workers and the people as the Communists. As I have pointed out earlier, the whole life of our party has been a ceaseless fight for the interests of the workers, the Negro people, the nation. In our demand for socialism for the United States, we are giving expression to the supreme interest of the overwhelming majority of the American people. It is precisely because the Communists are the very best defenders of the interests of the American people that eventually our party will be the leading party of the nation. I, as other Communists, love the American people and their glorious revolutionary democratic traditions, their splendid scientific and industrial achievements. And I love, too, our beautiful land, in every comer of which I have lived and worked. I want only the best of everything for our people and this country. I have only contempt, therefore, for the “foreign agent” charge, and doubly so because it comes from reactionaries who live by exploiting the American people and whose basic principle of operation is to peddle away the national welfare for the sake of their own narrow class interests.\n\nWe Communists revere our country. We are ardent patriots, but not nationalists. We defend the people’s interests but we do not try to shove official American (capitalist) interests ahead at the expense of those of other peoples. For that is the road to war and general ruin. We are Marxian internationalists. We realize very well the common interests that the workers and the peoples of the whole world have together. The key to an intelligent internationalism in our day is friendly co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union. This collaboration is indispensable if world peace is to prevail. On this basic issue we Communists stand four-square, come hell or high water! Our resolute position in this fundamental matter puts us into direct and irreconcilable collision with the imperialists. That’s why they and their “gangsters of the pen” so loudly denounce us as “foreign agents.” But their Red-baiting and persecution will be in vain so far as we are concerned. We can neither be coaxed, fooled, nor frightened away from our support of Soviet-American co-operation.\n\nThe United States, richly endowed with natural resources and highly developed industries, can perform a tremendously progressive role in this world full of poverty and mass suffering. But our country is being misled by Wall Street monopolists to use its vast resources in an attempt to subjugate the rest of the world for the profit of American imperialism. By following this fatal line our country, instead of being a progressive force, has become the most sinister menace to the peace and prosperity of all humanity. In the present critical world situation, the United States can live up to its democratic traditions and be an influence for world peace and progress only if our people smash the power of the ruling capitalists, take control themselves, and enter into genuinely fraternal relations with other peoples, particularly the U.S.S.R. The American people, with the workers in the lead, we may be confident, will not fail in the end to cleanse our nation and the world of the Wall Street warmongers and atom bomb firebrands.\n\nWe are living in a great historical period, that of the replacement of capitalism by socialism. In the working out of this tremendous process, the present period is an era of vast mass struggles, of wars, and of revolutions. Very probably socialism has already become the most powerful of the two rival systems. This is a good time in which to live; it is one that should give supreme inspiration to our youth. In my time I have seen much of this great struggle developing, and I would want nothing better than to live long enough to see the big undertaking of licking capitalism well completed. This job will not take so much longer; it is not a task of the dim and distant future. Sooner than we realize, with events traveling at their present rapid pace, mankind will have smashed capitalism, which is the last of the long series of great systems of exploitation by which the peoples have been enslaved and robbed throughout the centuries. The advent of world socialism, now standing historically at our doors, in fact, already across the threshold, will liberate man from his ages-long slavery and open up before him a perspective of freedom, development, and happiness that he now hardly dares dream of. Before very long the capitalist system, with all its organized greed and violence, will only be a dark memory to man as he travels into a future that will realize the very best of which our species is capable.\n\nUNITED STATES AND THE WORLD AMERICAN TRADE UNIONISM: Principles and Organization, Strategy and Tactics Williarm Z.

breathe the fresh air of political freedom. socialist political freedom gives them a new sense of human dignity, a new realization that they are truly individuals and not merely robots who are serving life sentences in dismal factories for the profit and glory of parasitic employers. the workers of the socialist soviet union possess a sense of freedom, of enjoying the rights of free speech and assembly, of being the masters of their own political fate, that is altogether unequaled in any capitalist country, including the united states. anybody who knows the russian working class is aware of this striking fact. today, because of the heavy pressure of capitalist reaction against the u.s.s.r., the soviet people are compelled to maintain a high degree of national discipline, a strong central government, and powerful armed forces. but once this world capitalist pressure is released, as it will be by the development of the victory of socialism, and also as the u.s.s.r. develops into communism, gradually dispensing with the present-type state and evolving into what engels calls “the administration of things,” then the soviet people will develop an exuberant democracy such as people in capitalist countries do not yet even dream of. in the meantime a never- ending struggle is carried on against bureaucratic hang-overs from capitalism. under socialism and communism the individual will be free politically to a degree unprecedented in man’s experience.\n\n3. socialism also brings intellectual freedom. this is a cornerstone of all personal development under any regime. with capitalist exploitation abolished, the main shackles are thereby also stricken from the mind. under socialism a regime of science prevails to a degree quite unheard of under capitalism. there is no ruling class to distort the findings of science and to cultivate superstition in order to bolster its class rule. those who believe in religion have the full right to practice it and others have an equal right to oppose religion. science under socialism will increasingly flourish and pass on to achievements altogether beyond the scope of science under the yoke of capitalism. the right of the people to the fullest education is a necessary part of this regime of science and intellectual freedom. the central aim of socialist society, unlike under capitalism, is to extend the maximum possible degree of scientific education to the broadest masses of the people. education becomes truly democratic only under socialism. an indication of what this signifies may be gathered from the fact that in the u.s.s.r. the government is already aiming at breaking down the old-time walls between intellectual work and manual work by raising the educational standards of the masses generally to those of engineers and technicians. this has now become practical policy in a country which only a few years ago was fighting to eliminate an 85 per cent illiteracy among its people. there is no real intellectual freedom for the people under capitalism. this great freedom in its full amplitude, which contributes so enormously to the dignity and individuality of man, arrives only with socialism.\n\n4. socialism also initiates an era of cultural freedom and growth. under every oppressive regime—whether slavery, feudalism, or capitalism—the arts and the artists have always been but so many weapons in the hands of the exploiters with which to help maintain their class rule. this has poisoned culture at its very heart. never was the stultification of culture more clearly seen than in the present imperialist phase of capitalism, when poetry, painting, drama, music, and literature are at record low levels. in all their complex modern forms and mediums, the arts are all thoroughly organized, standardized, and exploited by the capitalists. the arts have become robotized. under fascism, towards which imperialist capitalism naturally tends, art is degraded and paralyzed to the last degree. socialism frees culture from these strangling capitalistic restrictions by turning art in all its forms to the service of the whole people. it gives art and culture the most fertile field for growth they have ever experienced. socialism knows, at once, how to take advantage of collectivist mass production and also to cultivate the individual arts and handicrafts to the maximum. and there is no conflict between them. socialism, and the succeeding stage of communism, will be truly the age of art.\n\n5. one of the greatest of socialist freedoms is the freedom of woman. socialism establishes sex equality in the fullest sense of the word. it does away completely with the many disgusting bourgeois sex distortions and inhibitions, and makes of sex a truly free, beautiful, and artistic expression of man and woman. for a long time the succeeding systems of exploiters have forced woman into an artificial position of alleged inferiority to man. capitalism has done more than its share to maintain and extend this monstrous oppression. the capitalists exploit women doubly, both as workers and as women. woman has to face special oppression in every field in capitalist society—as a worker, a wife, a home-builder, and a citizen. whichever way she turns, she is confronted with subtle, and often crudely brutal, manifestations of “male supremacy” chauvinism. these cripple her in every respect. but socialism deals a shattering blow to this whole outrageous persecution system. it opens every door to woman, on the basis of the fullest freedom and equality. one of the very greatest achievements of socialism in the u.s.s.r. is the way it has extended real equality to women. the soviet woman is truly a new human being. she has learned altogether new capacities and rights and has amazed the world with her ability to do superlatively well anything she turns her hand to. the tremendous added power that emancipated woman gives to the soviet economy and political life is one of socialism’s greatest advantages over capitalism. the soviet woman is incomparably the freest woman in the world. if one wants to know whether socialism cultivates personality and individuality, a powerful answer is to be found in the progress made by soviet woman.\n\n6. socialism also establishes a new freedom for the youth. under capitalism all sorts of key posts, in every line of endeavor, are monopolized by old fogies with no other qualifications than that they got there first. youth, in capitalist countries, everywhere faces artificial handicaps. socialism opens all doors to youth. democratic regimes are always noted for the decisive role that youth plays in them, in every walk of life. this is, above all, true of socialism. by the same token, it is precisely under socialism that the nation looks after its aged and sick. in the soviet union, for example, there is no cold-hearted abandonment of the old and the incapacitated to the poverty and loneliness that is such a marked feature in all capitalist countries. the most tragic of all figures under capitalism are the older folks, who are so often without incomes, homes, or friends. in socialist regimes the care of children, too, is a sacred thing, without compare elsewhere in the world. socialism, as no other system of society, takes devoted care of its young, sick, and aged.\n\n7. another very important freedom established by socialism is national freedom. under capitalism one of the most poisonous of all influences is national chauvinism, the attempt of one national group to lord it over others on the basis of alleged superiority. socialism solves this urgent problem. under socialism the peoples of all nationalities and races live harmoniously together, without any prejudice or discrimination. no socialist citizen has to go through life under the crippling handicap and hardship, as hundreds of millions of capitalist citizens do, of being sneered at and persecuted because he is a negro, a jew, or a member of some other national group that the ruling class sees fit to harass and doubly exploit. in the u.s.s.r. the expression of such national prejudices is punishable as a crime. one of the outstanding achievements of the soviet union is the brotherly friendship and agreement that has been developed among the many nationalities comprising the soviet people. this system unites the nations into one socialist regime, yet in doing so it allows them to preserve their specific national customs and cultures. this national harmony has been accomplished upon the basis of practicing the strictest equality, regardless of color, creed, or national origin. the harmonious relation now existing among all the national groupings within the u.s.s.r. is a forerunner of the eventual world liquidation of the present deadly capitalist national hatreds, jealousies, and rivalries that will be brought about by socialism. it is the road to putting an end to international war. the elimination of national jealousies is an achievement altogether impossible under the jungle system of capitalism.\n\n8. socialism also gives the people a new, free ethics. the ethical principle of capitalism is “from each all you can squeeze out of him; to each all he can grab.” this is fundamentally a gangster ethics, and it is fitting for a society in which a man’s worth is measured by the amount of money he is able to amass in one way or another. capitalism, by its very nature, unavoidably places a premium upon thievery, corruption, and crookedness of every description. small wonder, then, that there is so much juvenile delinquency among our youth, when the dog- eat-dog ethics of capitalism stand before them constantly as the thing that they should emulate. socialism introduces a new and higher principle of social relations, and crime rapidly diminishes. its slogan is, “from each according to his abilities; to each according to his work.” this motto is based upon the non-exploitation character of socialist society. it fits right into the actual life of the people. and when this free society passes into the higher stage of communism it will be guided by a still loftier conception, namely, “from each according to his abilities; to each according to his needs.” this communist principle expresses a high degree of human solidarity and friendly relations that is quite unthinkable under capitalism.\n\nthroughout the ages the central principle of all great systems of morals has been, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” under slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, although the ruling classes have constantly preached this maxim to their slaves as a way by which to regulate their lives, they themselves have cynically ignored it in practice. their systems of exploitation, including present-day capitalism, have always been based upon a ruthless class ethics, condoning the most brutal violation of every principle of human solidarity. that is why christianity has never “worked.” as has been truly said, “it has never been tried.” it is only with the introduction of socialism, and later of communism, that the golden rule, without benefit of religion, becomes a matter of practical politics and of general acceptance by society as a whole.\n\nthe rise of socialism means the development of a whole new set of people’s freedoms to replace ruling class “freedoms” of capitalism, which are in reality just so many forms of slavery for the working class. thus, most important of all, goes “free enterprise,” which is only the capitalist freedom to exploit the workers, to be superseded by the genuine mass economic freedom from exploitation that is the very foundation of socialism. the right of irresponsible capitalists to throw the world periodically into economic crises and wars is also done away with. the rights of “free press,” in the bourgeois sense that a handful of capitalists are allowed to monopolize all the means of information for their own profit, is also abolished and is supplemented by trustworthy papers of the trade unions, the people’s state, and other democratic bodies. the right of the capitalistic ruling class to monopolize the government posts is done away with and the workers take the helm of state. the right of religious freedom under socialism becomes a true freedom, instead of the fake freedom under a state-supported church dominated by a reactionary hierarchy that it is under capitalism. the right of reactionary groups to discriminate against minority peoples (as in the case of the negroes in the united states) is ruthlessly abolished and all minorities under socialism enjoy the fullest equality in every sense. the “right,” too, of the man, under capitalism, to dominate economically and politically over the woman is done away with under socialism and woman becomes truly free. thus, through the whole category, new socialist rights supplant the ruling class rights of capitalism. but the capitalists, of course, don’t yield gracefully to abolishing their old system of rights in favor of working class, socialist rights. they constantly fill the air with outcries that the new socialist freedoms, under which mankind for the first time really becomes free, are a vicious system of totalitarianism. this is part of their general ideological campaign against advancing socialism.\n\nin addition to the foregoing list of elementary freedoms which contribute enormously to the development of human dignity and individuality, and which correct innumerable man-made injustices, socialism also attacks the series of limitations that have been placed upon man by nature itself. the general objective of this is to make women and men still more free and the masters of their fate. in this vital matter of conquering our natural difficulties socialism advances incomparably farther than capitalism can possibly go.\n\none of socialism’s most important developments in this general respect is to give men and women a richer and fuller life by radically improving their physical environment. under socialism, society will literally remodel the planet to suit its own needs, and with a boldness of plan impossible to disorganized, anarchistic, self-seeking capitalism. many examples of this elementary trend of socialism are already beginning to shape up in the u.s.s.r. among these are such projects as the conquest of the arctic for agriculture and industry; the recently announced fifteen-year plan to relieve 300,000,000 acres from drought conditions in the middle areas of the u.s.s.r.; the systematic development and conservation of natural resources that is taking place on all fronts, and the planned enrichment and protection of the soil generally so' as to provide properly nutritious foods for the people. these examples are only preliminary developments, merely indicators of the still more gigantic projects to come in the future, in socialist mankind’s adaptation of his environment to conform to his growing wants. the soviet union will never permit the wholesale destruction of the soil and the criminal waste of oil, lumber, iron, copper, and other natural resources of the people that has been one of the more scandalous aspects of the present capitalist regime in the united states. nor will that country ever allow the shameful adulteration and misuse of the people’s food supplies that is now going on unhampered in this country for the sake of the profits of food processors and monopolists.\n\nsocialism, in its endless striving for the best possible regime, will also make a decisive assault upon the many personal physical handicaps that hang like a millstone about the necks of women and men, and which capitalism is incapable of solving with its exploitation and its planless, hit-or-miss methods. preventive medicine on a general scale, mass physical culture, a scientifically adequate diet, and the most modern methods of medicine, will raise human beings under socialism to new heights of physical health and well-being. and far-reaching, concentrated research drives, on a scale that capitalism cannot equal, will make ever faster progress in the hunt for the causes and cures of the diseases that now plague mankind. man will free himself, under socialism, from the burden of sickness and disease that has cursed him for so long and which is such a distressing feature of present-day society. man, too, for the first time, disregarding foolish religious taboos, will boldly solve the population problems, both in respect to the size of his own individual family and that of the number of people in the nations generally. the spirit with which socialism will attack all these problems of the physical status of mankind is illustrated, among other thing, by the very important scientific work that is now being conducted in the u.s.s.r. regarding human longevity and the actual process of death.\n\nbut the biggest of all tasks to improve the physical well being of humanity and thereby the broadening of the base for its freedom, is to improve the human species itself in an evolutionary sense. as things now stand, capitalism is actually degenerating our species by its reckless violation of the laws of natural selection. it has been stated that napoleon with his many wars, which killed off the flower of young french manhood, cut two inches from the average height of all frenchmen; it is stated, too, that british workers, because of the ruinous effects of factory exploitation through many generations, average some inches shorter than do the aristocracy, and, as can be expected, the slaughter and maiming of so many millions of the finest men during the two recent world wars have done similar great damage to our species.\n\nsocialism will reverse these harmful effects of capitalism upon the welfare of our species and will start the latter upon an upward course of development. to improve a species through the application of what darwin called artificial selection, is a relatively simple thing to do with lower animals. to cultivate the evolution of the human species is quite another matter. to what extent a part will be played by eugenics, by controlling the endocrine glands, and especially by the creation of favorable environmental factors, as lysenko maintains, or by a combination of all three of these methods, i am neither a biologist nor a geneticist to pass an opinion upon. the vital matter of the evolution of mankind is not one that can any longer be left to chance, especially as capitalist society is now having such a negative effect on the development of the species. the law of natural selection, which built the marvelous complexities of plant and animal species, no longer can work spontaneously. now the evolution of the human species must be done artificially, by the conscious action of man himself.\n\nsocialism is still in its infancy, having been born only 31 years ago in the soviet union. its native land, since its fruition, has been overwhelmingly occupied in carrying out elementary tasks in the building of socialism—clearing away the material and intellectual rubbish of tsarism and capitalism; extending, under tremendous difficulties, its essential industrial base; and defending itself from incessant attacks from warlike capitalism. nevertheless, the u.s.s.r. has already given birth to socialist man. the main outlines are now pretty clear as to the makeup of this new individual. and as socialism advances and passes over into communism, the characteristics of the new socialist human being will become more and more definitely elaborated.\n\nsocialist man and woman are free individuals in the highest sense of the word. for thousands of years the toiling masses have struggled upward, fighting against succeeding systems of exploitation and oppression. but it is only with the defeat of capitalism and the establishment of socialism that they finally emerge from these long, varied forms of servitude. socialist man and woman have no masters, economic, political, intellectual, or religious. they represent mankind finally emancipated, achieving a truly upright position, freed from every kind of exploitation and oppression, and bending the knee to no one.\n\nsocialist man and woman have the basis for economic prosperity. they have at last won control of the instruments of production necessary to master their traditional poverty. the tremendous social production apparatus under socialism has as its main purpose, its sole reason for being, to provide the people with the highest possible living standards, not to furnish fat living for social parasites of one kind or another. no longer do devastating economic crises paralyze industry, no longer do the citizens fear unemployment, no longer do they live in dread as to what will happen to them and their families if they become incapacitated by illness or when they grow old. socialism completely solves all these economic problems and therewith lifts an alp from the minds of the workers who have suffered the ravages of brutal and needless poverty for endless centuries. with socialism, humanity finally enters the era of plenty. it is silly to charge that socialism exchanges freedom for plenty; it achieves both freedom and plenty.\n\nsocialist women and men are healthy human beings. for the first time in history, society turns its major efforts to achieving the maximum personal well-being for the people in general. it furnishes scientifically nutritious food and supplies the best of medical care, for prevention and for cure, from their birth to their death. the man and woman of socialism will be part of a species that is physically evolving to higher levels, and not retrograding, as under capitalism. socialism writes “finis” to the ages-long, shameless neglect and exploitation of man’s ill-health by society.\n\nsocialist man and woman are happy beings. mankind’s passage through the ages has been one of suffering and tragedy by reason of bad economic conditions and political oppression. bitter misery and corroding anxiety have always been the portion meted out to the toiling masses by the exploiting parasites in control of society. this is why there is so little happiness in capitalist countries. the united states, for all its wealth, is one of the unhappiest, most worried of countries. with the abolition of capitalism and its exploitation and oppression the people acquire a new buoyancy and win a new joy of life. this is true not only for the minority of developed communists who catch the full vista of the possibilities of socialism, but also for the broadest masses who respond chiefly to the economically and politically improved immediate situation. any reporter on the spot who has even a grain of honesty cannot help but remark the high spirits of the soviet people. despite all their heavy tasks in defending their country and in building socialism, and refuting all those hate-motivated writers who picture them as glum and dispirited, the russian masses are now undoubtedly the most spontaneously joyous people in the world. more than any other country, the u.s.s.r. is the land of song, music, and laughter. all revolutionary peoples display a similar mass happiness. even in the case now of the newly freed people of china, who have suffered so frightfully from the long civil war, there is a new-found happiness, as a writer in the new york herald-tribune, november 28, 1948, remarks. mrs. tesdell, a quaker missionary in china, dealing with conditions behind the communist lines, says: “the common people of northern china are the happiest i have ever seen.” the quakers are always spilling the beans like this. they don’t seem to understand that it is the capitalist line to portray all revolutionary peoples as the dismal victims of a handful of artful and sinister communists.\n\nsocialist women and men also possess new and more powerful incentives to work and live and enjoy. the time was, not long since, when capitalist writers, with a pontifical wave of the hand, used to tell us that socialism could not succeed because it destroyed human incentive. but, after experiencing a generation of the u.s.s.r. and its tremendous achievements, we are now hearing less and less of such nonsense. it is capitalism, with its manifold oppressions and repressions and with its paralyzing grip upon all social institutions, that checks and cripples the incentive of the great masses of the people. they are cramped and handicapped in every direction. it is only with the advent of socialism that they finally emerge from these long, varied forms of lowed to manifest itself. socialism is not a nirvana, where people vegetate in sloth and general stagnation. under socialism the citizen is encouraged to excel in every field, and to this end there is a tremendous competition and emulation among the masses in all lines of endeavor, in science, industry, sports, arts, etc. socialism cultivates all those qualities of initiative, ambition, strength, courage, and fighting spirit that are so essential for the rounded-out human being. socialism, for the first time in human experience, puts all these necessary qualities to constructive uses. the only limit laid upon them is that they be not exercised to enslave other human beings for exploitation purposes. in no country in the world is there such general striving for self-development and such a love of achievement as there is in the u.s.s.r.\n\nsocialist man and woman, in their full development, are marxian materialists. their intellectual and political life is established in scientific, economic, political, and social considerations, not according to the whims and interests of a barbaric ruling, exploiting class. the socialist people live under a rational system of planned economy, and are no longer lost in the vagaries and confusions of the anarchistic, chaotic capitalist system. their ethical code is not taken from the clouds, but from their position in society, where their personal interests dovetail perfectly with those of society as a whole. they also calmly look upon the basic facts of life and death, and they require no artificial solace or mental narcotic from ancient myths and fables. they have no room for existentialism and other forms of decadent bourgeois philosophy. only with a materialist viewpoint does mankind reach his fullest intellectual stature, freed of all inhibitions, fears, repressions, and superstitions. this viewpoint man will increasingly develop with the expansion of socialism and its growth into communism.\n\nsocialist woman and man are in harmony with their environment. this is the very heart principle of all the freedoms conferred upon mankind by socialism. throughout the long history of slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, the vast bulk of men and women have been grossly at odds with the society under which they have lived. they have been kicked around and butchered for centuries by gangs of exploiters who had managed to grab control of economic and political power. as a result, all of mankind’s natural human instincts and proclivities of solidarity have been repressed, thwarted, and stifled. this has made for measureless maladjustments and unhappiness throughout the several thousand years of man’s enslavement to exploiters of various kinds. the effects of these social maladjustments are especially manifest in our days under the capitalist system of exploitation, with all its crises and tensions. this is particularly so here in the united states, and it is the major cause of our mounting rates of crime, divorce, drug addiction, drunkenness, suicide, and insanity. socialism basically cures these mass social maladjustments by cutting out their main root, the exploitation of man by man. it therewith removes all those social pressures and strains and repressions that have wrought so much havoc with mankind throughout the ages and which have become so intense under capitalism as to threaten its very sanity. it is not only that great numbers of people now actually go insane in capitalist countries; the whole atmosphere of capitalism, with every man’s hand turned against his brother’s, is fundamentally neurotic and psychotic. capitalism is a sort of social insanity. the dangerous effects of capitalism upon people’s mentality is illustrated by the fact that in the present selective drafts no less than 50 per cent of the very high rate of military rejects is for mental troubles of one kind or another. socialism, by setting up a free regime, develops a sane, well-balanced human being, thoroughly in tune with the world in which he lives. this is the very sum of the achievements of socialism.\n\nalready, this fact of the harmony of the individual with his environment is very obvious in the u.s.s.r., despite its young years, and the extreme difficulties it has had to face in establishing socialism. the soviet people, for all their hardships, are a far happier and better balanced people mentally than those of the united states, notwithstanding the latter’s greater wealth and higher standards of living. the soviet people live in an atmosphere of friendly solidarity and they also have a clear social perspective ahead of them. this gives them a mentally healthy sense of stability and direction. this is almost entirely lacking in the united states, whose people live in a realm of daily insecurity and who do not know where they are going politically, with the consequence that they are plagued with all sorts of confusion.\n\nthese are some of the basic reasons for the striking fact that battle fatigue was relatively rare in the red army during world war ii, because the soviet soldiers knew and believed in what they were fighting for, whereas this serious mental disorder reached unprecedented heights in the american army, whose soldiers had by no means a clear social perspective, neither about the war nor about society in general. these facts also explain why there is such a frightfully high incidence of insanity in the united states, whereas mental disease is sharply on the decline in the u.s.s.r. this contrasting situation is definitely a reflection of the different degrees of social stability in the two countries. in the one case, in the united states, there is a gross maladjustment of the masses of the people to the dog-eat-dog capitalist environment in which they live, while in the other country, the u.s.s.r., the masses feel economically and socially secure and in harmony with socialism, although they still have many serious problems of construction before them. this harmonizing of man with his environment is the guiding principle for the building of socialism, a social system in which men and women will not only realize to the full their present abilities, but also, by improving the quality of the human species itself, will be able to soar to new capacities and achievements that people now do not even dream of in the capitalist world.\n\nthe foregoing paragraphs give at least an outline of some of the great advantages that socialism confers upon the individual. they indicate the basic fact that socialism, instead of suppressing the individual, raises him to his greatest heights. capitalist individualism is a sort of social cannibalism, it is an individualism based on the destruction of other individuals. only socialism can produce the real development and expression of the individual, in harmony with his fellows. it is typical of capitalist propaganda against socialism, however, that it should turn this basic fact inside out and portray socialism as the enemy of the individual. but the realities of socialism will in the long run triumph over such lies, concocted by an obsolete social system which is desperately fighting for its existence in the face of impossible odds.\n\n== xii. some personal observations ==\nthe previous chapters outline generally the most important economic and political developments of my lifetime, namely, the decline of world capitalism and the rise of world socialism, together with many of their major accompanying features, such as the imperialist role of the united states, the progress of the american labor movement, the decay of world social-democracy, the growth of the communist movement, and the advent of socialist man and woman. this concluding chapter i shall devote to my own personal connections with these tremendous events, together with some general remarks about the whole gigantic process of social development that is going on in this period.\n\ncapitalist opinion in these days, both here and abroad, is very frightened and confused. one would think the world was about to come to an end. and it is in a way, at least for the ruling class. the workers are in the course of putting an end to the ages-old system of mass exploitation under which they have suffered for so long. to them the world situation appears very reassuring indeed in its basic outlines. mankind is irresistibly on its way to socialism, and this is very, very good. every other consideration is secondary to this main issue.\n\nit is a terrible thing to view all the mass suffering, tyranny, and war devastation attendant upon the break-up of world capitalism and the birth of world socialism. but the responsibility for all this hardship and misery rests squarely upon the shoulders of the ruling capitalist class. it is not of the workers’ making, and they are doing all they can to prevent it. one would have to ignore basic lessons of history in order to believe that the capitalist parasites would step aside quietly and let the people peacefully take over the helm of society. they are behaving just as every other doomed ruling class in the past has done; they are fighting to the last to retain their system of organized robbery of the toiling masses. the principal difference is that this time the capitalist class, controlling its vast modern industrial machine, is very much more powerful than any previous ruling class. it has incomparably more dangerous means of destruction at hand and it is using them to the limit in its struggle against the rising social force, the working class. hence, in leaving (being shoved off) the stage of history, the capitalist class is capable of, and is, creating more havoc than any other vacating ruling class has ever done. with its atom bomb, it is insolently threatening not only civilization, but even the very existence of the planet. the big job of humanity, in working its way to socialism, therefore, is to reduce to the smallest minimum possible the economic chaos, fascism, war, and other violence and disorders caused by the capitalists during their propulsion into the historical discard. so far as the general social problem is concerned, the thing the workers have to do is to make the capitalists heed the advice that shakespeare somewhere gives an unwelcome guest; that is, “to stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.”\n\nall my working life i have fought against capitalism and for socialism. it is good to feel oneself on the progressive side in the great social struggle of our times and also to know that one’s side is winning. from my earliest youth i have been in conscious rebellion against capitalism. i cannot remember the time when i was not imbued with that class hatred against employers which is almost instinctive to workers. starting out at ten years of age and later working over 26 years in industry, i was an efficient worker but always a rebellious one. an omnivorous reader and blessed with an insatiable spirit of observation, i couldn’t help being repelled by the many oppressive conditions surrounding and immersing me. one of the very first signs of revolt on my part was the sharp revulsion i felt against the extremes of poverty and wealth that i saw about me. long before i had any inkling whatever of socialism or of the true meaning of capitalism, i was taking sharp issue, however confusedly, with a situation wherein millions of people were compelled to work themselves into early graves in the industries and to live in poverty during their lifetime, while the rich, who were obviously just so many loafers and wasters, enjoyed all the good things of life.\n\ni just couldn’t take all that. besides, my own bitter experiences in industry helped fill my cup to overflowing. the rank injustice of it all outraged my deepest sense of equality. during the many years that i worked in industry at very hard work, low wages and long hours (i never had a job of less than ten hours work per day, six days per week, and for ten years i slaved on the twelve-hour day, seven-day week at railroading), this spirit of revolt in me grew stronger and more conscious. i was a natural for the revolutionary movement. at 14 years of age i participated in my first strike, in philadelphia, and by the time i was 19, in 1900, i was already a member of the socialist party. this was getting a pretty early start as a militant in the american class struggle, and i already felt myself to be quite prepared to fight for socialism. but i was later to find out that it would still take me many years to learn the basic significance of socialism and to get rid of the complicated mess of ideological confusion that is customarily drilled into the minds of the workers, mine included, in order to make them into passive objects of capitalist exploitation.\n\nmy first long step towards a rational working class view of life and politics came through the liquidation of the religious beliefs that i had been so carefully taught during my boyhood. this, as it turned out, was a rather easy matter for me to accomplish. during my “teens,” long before i had come into contact with any socialist writings, i read many books, the total effect of which was to knock religion out of my head. among the more important of these works, in the general order of their reading, were paine’s age of reason, lecky’s history of european morals, draper’s conflict between science and religion, gibbon’s decline and fall of the roman empire, darwin’s origin of species and descent of man, and spencer’s data of sociology, plus many more works on science, sociology, history, and religion. when i got finished reading or, rather, devouring, these books, which were written in the days when capitalism was more honest intellectually than it is now, there was very little, if any, religion left in me. all i needed for a completely materialist outlook on life were the works of marx and engels, which i was to read some years later. i don’t consider my experiences with religion in any way extraordinary. i have always believed that anybody with an open mind who reads such basic books as i did could no longer believe the unsubstantiated myths and legends which constitute the material of religion.\n\nduring the course of my life i have never failed to marvel at how intelligent people can believe, for example, in the idea of a human-like deity, who rules over the immense universe, one who, in fact, created it. for my part, i’ll take the operation of natural laws as the explanation. likewise, with the question of immortality. contrary to those who think that man’s mental make-up demands that he must have a perspective of life after death, i see no necessity whatever for this self-deception. before i was conceived i had no consciousness of having any individual existence, and, in fact, i didn’t have any. it is perfectly logical and easy for me to believe that “my” status will be the same after death. hamlet says, “for in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,” but as for me, i am not troubled about such dreams. to my mind there is no difficulty whatever in grasping and accepting the thought of a return after death to a state of non-existence as a conscious being. indeed, how can anyone really believe anything else? in my judgment the only way modern people can accept such ideas as a deity and immortality (not to mention various other religious conceptions), totally unsupported as they are by any reasonable weighing of facts or logic, is by accepting them blindly on faith. under the pressure of revered and hoary religious institutions, as well as because of strong social institutional compulsions, they adopt these conceptions mechanically, without any reasoned consideration of them whatsoever. were such people really to weigh them thoughtfully, as they do other matters in their lives, they could do nothing else but reject them. the days of heaven and hell are past for men and women who actually think about such matters. this is not to say, however, that there are not myriads of sincere and fine people in the world who honestly believe in religion as something above reason, and not a few of them are good fighters in the various communist parties of the world.\n\nmy break with religion had a considerable material effect upon the course of my life. my mother had long wanted to make a priest of me, and her wishes were seconded by father joseph o’connor, a noted orator of st. theresa’s church in philadelphia, and a friend of mine. he offered to send me to a jesuit college to be educated for the priesthood. he and my mother were both disappointed, however, when i let it be known to them that my reading had already taken me far and away beyond the control of the catholic church.\n\nthe second big step forward for me ideologically was my breaking with the whole intellectual baggage of capitalism proper and my acceptance of the perspective of socialism. the final break was rather a swift process for me, in fact, almost a matter of an hour. i was 19 years old at the time, and undoubtedly my previous extensive reading and my already considerable experience of nine years as a worker had quite prepared my mind for this sudden mutation from a capitalist to a socialist outlook. it all took place during my very first contact with the socialist movement, at an open air meeting at the corner of broad and south streets in philadelphia during the early summer of 1900. i think it was conducted by the socialist labor party. this was the first time i had ever heard a socialist speaker and his presentation won me immediately and completely. it took very little argument on his part to convince me that capitalists were both useless and harmful to society. i readily grasped the points that the workers were the useful producers, that they were potentially strong enough to take over society, and that, once in power, they would be quite capable of managing the economic of course, in the new world outlook that i had gained so suddenly there was much on my part that was raw and unfinished. many times since then, in the fight for socialism, i have had to shift my conception of political strategy and tactics, nevertheless the heart of my new viewpoint was as sound as oak and it has persisted with me. since those far-off days when i became a socialist, almost half a century ago, i have learned through hard knocks that the capitalists’ defense of their system is much more complex and far more stubborn than i even dreamed of and that the struggle for socialism is correspondingly a very difficult one. but my whole experience has gone to justify the correctness of the basic decision i then took to work and fight for socialism. the most important day in my life was the one in the far-off summer of 1900, when i first met up with marxism and took my place in the ranks of the international movement for socialism. i have often wondered who the soap-box teacher was who had such a vital influence upon my political development.\n\nmy adoption of socialism, like my acceptance of the materialistic outlook on life, also had a big effect upon my future work. about that time i had gotten myself a pretty good job as a minor executive in armour & company’s large fertilizer plant in jacksonville, florida. the big boss there told me that i was right in line for a rapid promotion, inasmuch as, although only 19 years of age, i already knew the business well. but now that i had become a socialist i simply could not become part of the employers’ apparatus for exploiting the workers. so that was that. i quit my promising job in the executive field and went my way into other industries as a worker. this was a happy choice of route for me.\n\nthe third big ideological phase of my political evolution was to rid my mind of the illusions of opportunist social-democracy. the ideology of social-democracy is an extension of the ideology of capitalism itself. the right-wing social-democrats have no faith in the ability of the workers to gain political power, to maintain power if they should get control, or to manage the complex machinery of capitalism. in fact, they see no need at all for a socialist revolution. their line consists of tinkering with and reforming capitalism. they don’t envisage knocking the capitalists really out of power. john maynard keynes, the british economist, has, in effect, given them their real economic program, which is the impossible one of transforming reactionary, monopolist capitalism into what they designate as “progressive capitalism.” their reformed capitalism, which they call socialism, would have, they think, an indefinite lease on life. all this opportunist work these people do under slogans of socialism. the practical effect of social-democracy, and it is for this that it is so highly valued by the capitalists, is to take the revolutionary punch out of the workers during political crises by fooling them into believing that there is an easier way than that of hard struggle to get socialism. they want the workers to leave everything to evolving capitalism and, then, they say, all will be well. social- democracy is one of the major pillars of the capitalist system, its basic prop in the ranks of the working class. to free themselves from this social-democratic deception is a most difficult ideological task confronting the workers of all capitalist countries.\n\nalmost as soon as i had joined the socialist party in 1900 i became a member of its left wing. like other militant workers at the time, at many points in the practical work of the party i came into sharp conflict with the flock of opportunist, middle class elements and trade union bureaucrats, who were running the party. more and more, too, i took issue with these elements on theoretical grounds, with the general consequence that in 1909, as a result of a party split in the state of washington, i found myself outside the socialist party. i never went back to it again. by then i had become thoroughly convinced that the socialist party would never bring about socialism, despite all its radical phrases. and the ensuing 40 years have borne out this conclusion. during these tempestuous years social-democracy has amply demonstrated itself to be a barrier against socialism. my break with the ideology of social-democracy was a big milestone in the general course of my political growth.\n\nmy eventual rejection of social-democracy, including the undeveloped variety represented by the conservative trade union leadership, also had a decisive effect upon my life activities. otherwise it would have been an easy matter for me to find a soft berth in the labor bureaucracy, as so many others had done. thus, during the years when i headed major organizing campaigns for the a. f. of l. in meatpacking and steel, 1917-20, sam gompers dangled before me a goodpaying job as an a. f. of l. general organizer, and martin ryan, the president of my union, the brotherhood of railway car men of america, asked me to take over the editorship of the union’s national journal. but my left views made such jobs out of the question for me. i just couldn’t see myself becoming a cog in the big bureaucratic machine dominating the trade union movement.\n\nmy next big ideological advance, after getting rid of my religious, capitalistic, and social-democratic illusions, was my gradual development as a communist. this was no simple matter and it took me about a dozen years more to accomplish. during most of this interim time i was a syndicalist, believing that the unions alone could bring about socialism. i joined the communist party early in 1921, about 18 months after it was organized. the major factor that decided me to take this big step was the stupendous reality of the russian revolution, together with an intensive reading of the works of lenin. becoming a communist meant for me to put the logical capstone upon my whole previous life experience. i had reached my political destination. since joining the communist party it has been a never-ending effort on my part, with such diligence and self-criticism as i can command, to master the revolutionary principles of marx, engels, lenin, and stalin, and to apply them effectively in the american class struggle.\n\nthis long ideological development of mine represents, in a general way at least, the broad course of intellectual growth taken by the masses in their march towards socialism. but mine is the story of the development of an individual, not of a class. the working class, with the support of its democratic allies, in their struggle against the intolerable abuses of capitalism, will have established socialism long before the bulk of the masses have grasped more than the most elementary principles of marxism. there can be no revolutionary movement without revolutionary theory, correctly says lenin. here is where the party comes in. it is the bearer of marxist-leninist theory and the practical leader of the masses.\n\nmy life in the labor, left-wing, and communist movement has been a very happy one. it has given me the opportunity to do the thing closest to my heart and mind—to fight against reactionary capitalism and for progressive socialism. from my earliest youth i have always felt a great pride in being a worker, and it has ever been a matter of the deepest satisfaction to me to be able to identify myself so closely with the struggles of the working class. if i were starting out my life all over again, i would take the same course as i have done; but naturally i would try to bypass the many political mistakes that i have made. one thing i would surely do, despite the press of practical work, would be better to organize my time so as to enable me to indulge more than i have in the reading of the science and history that i love so much. this is one thing that the youth in the labor and communist movement should most resolutely strive to accomplish—to combine the theoretical with the practical, to find time for lots of solid reading, notwithstanding the most urgent demands of the day-to-day struggle.\n\nbuilding the communist party in the united states, the citadel of world capitalism, is no easy job. indeed, i think party building is probably more difficult here than in any other leading country. in many lands communists have been subjected to various sorts of persecution and hardship and they have resolutely triumphed nevertheless. our problem in this country, thus far at least, is not so much that of combating such terrorism—although we have had a taste of that, too—as it is of prevailing over the insidiously corrupting effects of lush american capitalism. it is especially hard in this land of comparatively high living standards to make the workers understand the flimsiness of american “prosperity,” the advantage of having communist leadership in their daily struggles, and to convince them of the need for the eventual establishment of socialism. for american imperialism obviously still exerts a powerfully corrupting influence upon the minds of huge sections of the working class. marx long ago pointed out the similar corrupting effects of british imperialism upon the skilled british workers. but we american communists have never been dismayed by this insidious difficulty. we realize perfectly well that when capitalism in this country begins to feel basically the disintegrating forces which are now wrecking world capitalism, and it inevitably must feel them, then the american working class, faced with rapidly deteriorating working and living conditions, will swing swiftly and heavily to the left. our party works and builds within the framework of this sure perspective.\n\ndespite all the insidious, corrupting influences of american capitalism, and notwithstanding our own many shortcomings as political fighters, we communists have nevertheless succeeded in building the core of what will one day be a great mass communist party in the united states. in the process we have taught many thousands of the most advanced workers the elements of marxism-leninism. our party has also had a vast experience on many fronts of the american class struggle. in innumerable big fights of trade unionists, of the negro people, of the farmers, of the people generally, we have demonstrated to the masses the value of communist leadership. of course, we could and should have done much better under the circumstances. with more effective work we could have a party of double or triple its present size. nevertheless, those things we have done constitute major achievements. they were the sowing of seed which will one day bring forth a rich harvest. the 70,000 members of the party may seem indeed a small force, and truly they are, to face up to the tremendous power of american capitalism. but numbers are not everything, important though they may be. quality and program count even more in the long run. communist parties, when favorable situations arrive, have the power of swift and solid growth. the russian communist party, a generation ago, gave a brilliant, classic, example of this. under mussolini, the italian communist party, its militants persecuted, imprisoned, and butchered, had only about 15,000 members and it appeared to be but a weak group when confronted with the big armies and fascist bluster of ii duce. but today that party has 2,300,000 members, mussolini “lies mouldering in his grave,” and the communists are on their way to the leadership of italy. or take the even more striking case of the chinese communist party. in 1930, under constant attack from the apparently overwhelmingly superior chiang kai-shek armies, this party had only 10,000 members, among a vast sea of 475,000,000 people. it faced a terrific struggle even to survive. but the party had sound principles, brilliant leadership, and a favorable situation for growth. so that today, the chinese communist party has 3,000,000 members. as i write these words, it is rapidly winning its way to the leadership of the great chinese people. so why should we be dismayed at the difficulties we encounter in building our communist party in this country?\n\nthe communist party of the united states, for all its present small size, has a decisive historical role to play. the united states, like every other capitalist economy, must, through the destructive effects of its inner contradictions and as a result of ever growing class struggle, eventually become a socialist country. the communist party will have to lead the people to the new socialist regime, for there is no other party that can possibly do this. but our party will not be alone in this, of course; it will be at the head of a great people’s democratic coalition fighting against the evils of monopoly, imperialism, economic chaos, fascism, and war—against capitalism. our party, when it arrives at this historic moment, will not fail. as so many other communist parties have done, it will in the meantime have produced the necessary trained leadership and rallied around itself the resolute fighting masses needed to write the epitaph of american capitalism. »\n\ncapitalism in this country may possibly last until after the great issue of capitalism versus socialism has been definitely settled on a world scale in favor of socialism. but, in any event, our country must also go socialist and the communist party will surely be called upon to play a decisive leading role. our party does not contemplate this future mechanically or fatalistically. it knows perfectly well that only if it puts forth the utmost efforts to build and develop will it be able to take its part in the ever-increasing daily struggle of the masses and also, finally, to lead the workers politically on their march to socialism. such leaders as mao tse-tung, dimitrov, togliatti, pauker, rakosi, and thorez did not spring up overnight, nor do effective mass communist parties such as theirs spontaneously appear on the scene. they, both leaders and parties, are the products of many years of hard struggle and ideological development. our party is now passing through this long and difficult school of preparation.\n\nthe big american swing to the left will come sooner than most people expect, and it will have surprising depth and sweep. the united states is now living upon the thin crust of a live volcano. a devastating cyclical economic crisis is developing. the united states cannot possibly secure markets under capitalist conditions for the huge mass of products of its war-swollen industries. even before world war ii this was impossible (result, the 1929 crash), and it is now more than ever impossible to find ample markets, what with american productive capacity doubled since the ’twenties and the impoverished peoples of the capitalist world still less able to buy. danger signs for american capitalism are multiplying fast. the war-created shortages in this country are being rapidly overcome, the stockpiles are swiftly heaping up, the people’s wartime accumulated backlog of purchasing power has become practically exhausted, the industries are beginning to reduce operations, and mass unemployment is again appearing. all this constitutes an economic crisis in the making. nor can the government avert this crisis by its keynesian policies, whether in their reactionary or liberal variants; that is, by squandering huge sums on armaments and by making piddling concessions to the workers in the shape of miserly increases in minimum wages, pinch-penny improvements in unemployment insurance, and niggardly health programs. nor can president truman’s fantastic scheme for the capitalist development of backward areas solve the problem. american capitalism cannot set up a “managed economy,” in which deflationary and inflationary factors are safely controlled. truman’s “managed economy,” which is a shield for developing a war economy and for promoting state monopoly capitalism, can only sharpen the contradictions of capitalism instead of “regulating” and “controlling” them. the economic crisis of 1929-33, with all its tragic mass misery, caused the united states to go to the left, and to adopt the many reforms of the roosevelt new deal. the coming economic cyclone will push it even further and more permanently to the left. in the ensuing struggles the workers will then gradually transform the present small communist party into a big mass organization. american imperialism towards fascism and war, the communist party is being kicked around and abused. our members are denied the right to hold jobs in the government service and to serve as trade union officials. in many cases, they are also being blacklisted from industry. our members and leaders, including 12 members of our national committee, are arrested and put on trial. the whole party is being blasted by the most frantic campaign of red-baiting in the nation’s history. the general aim of all this persecution is to outlaw the party, to break it up if possible. this is fascist policy, and a key part of the war program. the reactionaries realize that if they can but outlaw the communist party then it will be much easier for them to attack the trade unions and all other democratic movements and popular rights. the communist party is the first line of defense of american democratic liberties. if our party can be stripped of its rights, no other democratic organization will be safe. the people responsible for this orgy of redbaiting reaction are brazenly advertising themselves all over the world as the champions of democracy. this assault, of course, will not break up our party, but will have the reverse effect of steeling it and strengthening its fiber. after all the experience the world has given us in such matters, it is stupid to think that the communist party can be crushed by violence. in the face of this attack, we communists are practical people. we have no yearning for the crown of martyrdom, but, if need be, our morale will prove strong enough to withstand whatever attacks the capitalists are able to mete out. communists have demonstrated their courage and fighting capacity all over the world, time and again.\n\nthey are charging that we communists propose to overthrow the united states government by force and violence. this is a brazen lie and they know it. it is stupid to call ours a program of force and violence. any violence that may occur in the course of the people’s democratic advance towards socialism inevitably stems from the capitalist reactionaries who, like all obsolete ruling classes, try to stop the advance of the new order of society by setting up fascist-like regimes and by using their armed force against the masses. that, in a nutshell, is the truth about the question of force and violence in the class struggle. another truth, still more important, is the fact that the awakened peoples, in whatever country, will never allow their march toward socialism to be stopped by ruling class violence. they will fight if democratic procedures are denied them, as history amply proves. hitler could tell us something about what aroused democratic nations will do. the right of revolution cannot be taken away from the people.\n\nreactionaries are charging, too, that communists are “foreign agents,” who betray the interests of the american people. i, along with other communists, challenge this lying charge. there is no other group as loyal to the interests of the workers and the people as the communists. as i have pointed out earlier, the whole life of our party has been a ceaseless fight for the interests of the workers, the negro people, the nation. in our demand for socialism for the united states, we are giving expression to the supreme interest of the overwhelming majority of the american people. it is precisely because the communists are the very best defenders of the interests of the american people that eventually our party will be the leading party of the nation. i, as other communists, love the american people and their glorious revolutionary democratic traditions, their splendid scientific and industrial achievements. and i love, too, our beautiful land, in every comer of which i have lived and worked. i want only the best of everything for our people and this country. i have only contempt, therefore, for the “foreign agent” charge, and doubly so because it comes from reactionaries who live by exploiting the american people and whose basic principle of operation is to peddle away the national welfare for the sake of their own narrow class interests.\n\nwe communists revere our country. we are ardent patriots, but not nationalists. we defend the people’s interests but we do not try to shove official american (capitalist) interests ahead at the expense of those of other peoples. for that is the road to war and general ruin. we are marxian internationalists. we realize very well the common interests that the workers and the peoples of the whole world have together. the key to an intelligent internationalism in our day is friendly co-operation between the united states and the soviet union. this collaboration is indispensable if world peace is to prevail. on this basic issue we communists stand four-square, come hell or high water! our resolute position in this fundamental matter puts us into direct and irreconcilable collision with the imperialists. that’s why they and their “gangsters of the pen” so loudly denounce us as “foreign agents.” but their red-baiting and persecution will be in vain so far as we are concerned. we can neither be coaxed, fooled, nor frightened away from our support of soviet-american co-operation.\n\nthe united states, richly endowed with natural resources and highly developed industries, can perform a tremendously progressive role in this world full of poverty and mass suffering. but our country is being misled by wall street monopolists to use its vast resources in an attempt to subjugate the rest of the world for the profit of american imperialism. by following this fatal line our country, instead of being a progressive force, has become the most sinister menace to the peace and prosperity of all humanity. in the present critical world situation, the united states can live up to its democratic traditions and be an influence for world peace and progress only if our people smash the power of the ruling capitalists, take control themselves, and enter into genuinely fraternal relations with other peoples, particularly the u.s.s.r. the american people, with the workers in the lead, we may be confident, will not fail in the end to cleanse our nation and the world of the wall street warmongers and atom bomb firebrands.\n\nwe are living in a great historical period, that of the replacement of capitalism by socialism. in the working out of this tremendous process, the present period is an era of vast mass struggles, of wars, and of revolutions. very probably socialism has already become the most powerful of the two rival systems. this is a good time in which to live; it is one that should give supreme inspiration to our youth. in my time i have seen much of this great struggle developing, and i would want nothing better than to live long enough to see the big undertaking of licking capitalism well completed. this job will not take so much longer; it is not a task of the dim and distant future. sooner than we realize, with events traveling at their present rapid pace, mankind will have smashed capitalism, which is the last of the long series of great systems of exploitation by which the peoples have been enslaved and robbed throughout the centuries. the advent of world socialism, now standing historically at our doors, in fact, already across the threshold, will liberate man from his ages-long slavery and open up before him a perspective of freedom, development, and happiness that he now hardly dares dream of. before very long the capitalist system, with all its organized greed and violence, will only be a dark memory to man as he travels into a future that will realize the very best of which our species is capable.\n\nunited states and the world

replaces him; the cia fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. 1\n* from 1961 onward, the us school of americas, a us department of defense institute in fort benning, georgia, was assigned the specific goal of teaching \"anti-communist counterinsurgency training,\" to cia-supported right wing paramilitaries. it trained more than 19,000 students from 36 countries in the western hemisphere, including several latin american dictators, and, during the 1980s, included torture in its curriculum.\n* in the 1962 cuban missile crisis, the joint chiefs of staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale nuclear attack and invasion was the only solution, nearly plunging the world into nuclear war.\n* in 1964, a cia-backed military coup in brazil overthrows the democratically elected government of joao goulart. the junta that replaces it will, in the next two decades, become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. general castelo branco creates latin america’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down communists and political opponents for torture, interrogation and murder. later it is revealed that the cia trained the death squads. thousands were tortured, and hundreds were killed.\n* in 1965, the us intervened in the dominican civil war, providing air support and 1,700 marines. this later transformed into an organization of american states occupation of the country. 1\n* in 1968, a cia-organized military operation in bolivia led by cuban exile and cia agent félix rodríguez captures legendary guerilla che guevara, defeating the ñancahuazú guerrilla. the bolivian president ordered his immediate execution to prevent worldwide calls for clemency, and the drama of a trial. nazi war criminal klaus barbie aka \"the butcher of lyon\", advised and possibly helped the cia orchestrate guevara's eventual capture.\n* in 1969, amid a collapsing economy, labor and student strikes in uruguay, cia operative dan mitrione initiates a campaign of torture and violence against the left-wing student group tuparamos. former uruguayan police officials and cia operatives stated mitrione had taught torture techniques to uruguayan police, including the use of electrical shocks delivered to his victims' mouths and genitals. it has been alleged that he used homeless people for training purposes, who were executed once they had served their purpose.\n* starting in the 1970s, a cia-backed coalition of right wing governments in argentina, ecuador, peru, chile, uruguay, paraguay, bolivia and brazil, began operation condor, a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, with the stated aim of \"eliminating marxist subversion.\" victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerillas. an estimated 30,000 to 80,000 leftists or sympathizers were killed. 1\n* in 1971, a cia operative told a reporter he delivered a strain of the african swine fever virus from an army base in the canal zone to anti-castro cubans. an outbreak of the disease then occurred in cuba, resulting in the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to prevent a nationwide animal epidemic. it was labeled the \"most alarming event\" of 1971 by the united nations food and agricultural organization.1\n* in 1971 in bolivia, after half a decade of cia-inspired political turmoil, a cia-backed military coup overthrows the leftist president juan jose torres, eventually being kidnapped and murdered by cia backed right wing death squads, as part of operation condor. in the next two years, dictator hugo banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed. banzer wwas trained at the u.s.-operated school of the americas in panama and later at fort hood, texas. a few years later the catholic church denounced an army massacre of striking tin workers in 1975, banzer, assisted by information provided by the cia, was able to target and locate leftist priests and nuns. his anti-clergy strategy, known as the banzer plan, was adopted by nine other latin american dictatorships in 1977.\n* on 11 september 1973, the cia backed a military coup to remove democratically elected socialist president salvador allende, in favor of right-wing dictator augusto pinochet. his us-supported regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent that was unprecedented in the history of chile, backed by the neoliberal free-market economic policies of the chicago boys. over-all, the regime left over 3,000 dead or \"dissappeared\", tortured thousands of prisoners, and forced 200,000 chileans into exile. he's known for the villa grimaldi, a torture complex, and his caravan of death, a chilean army death squad guilty of countless atrocities, including dropping pregnant women and teenagers out of helicopters in the ocean, and executions where prisoners were shot by parts, over extended periods of time.  pinochet's forces are conservatively estimated to have killed over 11,000 people in his first year in power. 1, 2\n* in 1976, the cia backed an overthrow of argentinan leader isabel martínez de perón by right wing anti-communist dictator jorge rafael videla. in 1983, two years after the return of a representative democratic government, he was prosecuted in the trial of the juntas for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule, including kidnappings or forced disappearance, widespread torture and extrajudicial murder of activists, and political opponents as well as their families at secret concentration camps, and harboring nazis. an estimated 13,000 -30,000 political dissidents vanished during this period. videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime. in his defence, videla maintains the female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to fall pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed. 1\n* in 1976, several cia-linked anti-castro cuban exiles and members of the venezuelan secret police disip were responsible for a terrorist bomb attack on cuban flight 455, killing 73 people. cia venezuelan operative luis posada carriles, one of the bombers, fled and was granted amnesty in the us in 2007. 1\n* in 1979, the us-backed dictator anastasios samoza ii falls, beginning the popular nicaraguan revolution. remnants of his guard will become the contras, who fight a cia-backed guerilla war against the left-wing sandinista government throughout the 1980s, with reagan authorizing covert support to anti-sandinista forces. 1\n* in 1979, the cia began to destabilize grenada after maurice bishop became president, for his marxist, pro-cuba, anti-racism, and anti-apartheid stances. the previous leader, eric gairy, was a british/us puppet who furthered imperialist interests in the region, sacked the treasury, presided over 47% unenemployment, and a 200% cost of living increase. his right wing gang / secret police, the mongoose gang, ruthlessly tortured leftists, sending his police to pinochet's argentina to learn torture techniques, and even murdered maurice's father. under bishop's leadership, women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. organisations for education (center for popular education), health care, and youth affairs (national youth organization) were also established, as well as free education and health care. a literacy campaign lowered it to less than 5% in 3 years. the campaign against him resulted in his overthrow and the invasion by the u.s. of grenada on october 25, 1983, with about 277 people dying.\n* in 1980, in el salvador, the archbishop of san salvador, oscar romero, pleads with president carter to stop aiding the military government slaughtering his people. carter refuses. right-wing leader roberto d’aubuisson has romero shot through the heart while saying mass. the country soon dissolves into civil war, with the peasants in the hills fighting against the military government. the cia and u.s. armed forces supply the government with overwhelming military and intelligence superiority, as well as over 3000 tons of us made bombs, training death squads to roam the countryside, committing atrocities like that of el mozote in 1982, where 800 civilians were massacred. by 1992, some 63,000 salvadorans were killed. back then salvador was controlled by a mafia of 13 families who owned 50% of the land and wealth. the 13 families were heavily linked with the united states. cia provided weapons and military training to the salvadorean army, as well as $6b in aid, and us military training in panama. as soon as the cia discovered the priests were indoctrinating the masses, they began killing them.\n* in the 1980s the cia supported battalion 316, a torture/assassination squad in honduras, which kidnapped, tortured and killed hundreds of its citizens. battalion 316 used shock and suffocation devices in interrogations , and prisoners often were kept naked and, when no longer useful, killed and buried in unmarked graves. declassified documents and other sources show that the cia and the u.s. embassy knew of numerous crimes, including murder and torture, yet continued to support battalion 316 and collaborate with its leaders. these constitute war crimes.1\n* from 1982-89, the u.s. government attempted to topple the government of nicaragua by secretly arming, training and funding the contras, a terrorist group based in honduras that was created to sabotage nicaragua and to destabilize the nicaraguan government.as part of the training, the cia distributed a detailed \"terror manual\" entitled \"psychological operations in guerrilla war,\" which instructed the contras, among other things, on how to blow up public buildings, to assassinate judges, to create martyrs, and to blackmail ordinary citizens. in 1986, the nicaraguan government under the sandinistas shoots down a c-123 transport plane carrying military supplies to the contras. the lone survivor, eugene hasenfus, turns out to be a cia employee, as are the two dead pilots, contradicting reagan's claims that the us was not aiding the contras. 1\n* in 1987, the former cia station chief in angola in 1976, john stockwell, testified to congress and told a grisly tale of us involvement on behalf of business interests in latin america. he cited covert operations in nicaragua, panama, guatemala, haiti, the dominican republic, and cuba. over the course of his testimony, he estimated that given the bombings of water supplies and other essential infrastructure, the invasions, the coups, that the united states, on its quest for empire, has been responsible for 6,000,000 deaths. the cia retaliated by suing him into bankruptcy. 1\n* in the 1980s and 1990s, the u.s. supplied military equipment and substantial aid for the columbian government in their civil war to fight against farc, known as plan columbia. the weapons, ostensibly delivered for use against narcotics traffickers, was being used by the colombian military to commit abuses in the name of “counter-insurgency.” one estimate is that 67,000 deaths have occurred from the 1960s to recent years due to support by the u.s. of colombian state terrorism. another 1994 amnesty international report, stated that more than 20,000 people were killed for political reasons in colombia since 1986, mainly by the military and its paramilitary allies.\n* in 1989, the u.s. invades panama to overthrow a dictator of its own making, general manuel noriega, with the stated goal of \"defending democracy and human rights in panama\". noriega had been on the cia’s payroll since 1966, collecting at least $100,000 per year from the u.s. treasury. as he rose to be the de facto ruler of panama, he became even more valuable to the cia, reporting on meetings with fidel castro and daniel ortega of nicaragua and supporting u.s. covert wars in central america, and had been transporting drugs with the cia’s knowledge since 1972. by the late 80s, noriega’s growing independence and intransigence had angered washington. between 500-4,000 people died in the us invasion.\n* in 1990 in haiti, competing against 10 comparatively wealthy white candidates, leftist priest jean-bertrand aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. a few months later, the cia-backed military deposes him in a coup. more military dictators brutalize the country, as thousands of haitian refugees escape the turmoil in barely seaworthy boats. the cia \"paid key members of the coup regime forces, identified as drug traffickers, for information from the mid-1980s at least until the coup.\" coup leaders cédras and françois had received military training in the united states. as popular opinion calls for aristide’s return, the cia begins a disinformation campaign painting the courageous priest as mentally unstable.1\n* in 1996, investigative journalist gary webb exposed a cia-run business of selling cocaine produced in nicaragua, to help fund the anti-communist contras in their fight against the sandinistas in nicaragua. these drugs were mostly sold to black communities in california, and helped spark the crack epidemic. several of the us dealers such as such as ross and oscar danilo blandon, were found to have cia and dea ties. webb's reports were suppressed in the news media. in 1997, webb stated: \"if we had met five years ago, you wouldn't have found a more staunch defender of the newspaper industry than me ... and then i wrote some stories that made me realize how sadly misplaced my bliss had been. the reason i'd enjoyed such smooth sailing for so long hadn't been, as i'd assumed, because i was careful and diligent and good at my job ... the truth was that, in all those years, i hadn't written anything important enough to suppress.\" in 2004, webb was found dead in his home, shot in the back of the head twice. his death was ruled a suicide.\n* in 2009, a coup in honduras has led to severe repression and death squad murders of political opponents, union organizers and journalists. at the time of the coup, u.s. officials denied any role in the coup and used semantics to avoid cutting off u.s. military aid as required under u.s. law. but two wikileaks cables revealed that the u.s. embassy, and secretary of state hillary clinton, was the main power broker in managing the aftermath of the coup and forming a government that is now repressing and murdering its people, including popular leader berta cáceres. the two men who killed berta cáceres were trained in the us. a former soldier with the us-trained special forces units of the honduran military asserted that caceres' name was included on a hitlist distributed to them months before her assassination.[ according to a february 2017 investigation by the guardian, court papers purport to show that three of the eight people arrested in connection with the assassination are linked to the us-trained elite troops. two of them, maj mariano díaz and lt douglas giovanny bustillo, received military training in the us.,2\n* following a series of terrorist attacks against cuba (such as the bombing of cuban commercial flight 455, that originated from anti-castro cuban exile groups in the us, such as  alpha 66, the f4 commandos, the cuban american national foundation, and brothers to the rescue), the cuban government sent spies to infiltrate these insurgent groups operating in miami. afterwards, the cuban government then provided 175 pages of documents to fbi agents investigating posada carriles's (a former cia operative) role in the 1997 terrorist bombings in havana, but the fbi failed to use the evidence to follow up on posada. instead, they used it to uncover and imprison the cuban spies, known as the cuban five. [[. the cuban five said they were spying on miami's cuban exile community, not the us government. they were imprisoned from 1998, until their eventual release via a prisoner swap in 2014. the terrorist bomber posada carriles (who admitted to planning 6 bombings of havana hotels and restaurants) lived in miami and was safeguarded by the us government until his death in 2018. 2\n* in 2017, hurricane maria hit puerto rico, leaving 3.4 million without electricity and fuel, and causing an estimated $50 billion in damage. 55% of puerto ricans have no potable water,  in one of the worst humanitarian crises in decades. in marked contrast to the initial relief efforts for hurricane katrina and the 2010 haiti earthquake, on september 22 the only signs of relief efforts were beleaguered puerto rican government employees. the us response has been dismal, leading many to believe that the us prefers a decapitalized puerto rico. on september 29, san juan mayor cruz held a press conference to plead for aid and to highlight failures by fema, saying, \"this is what we got last night. four pallets of water, three pallets of meals, and 12 pallets of infant food — which, i gave them to the people of comerío, where people are drinking off a creek. so i am done being polite. i am done being politically correct. i am mad as hell.\" cruz continued. \"so i am asking the members of the press, to send a mayday call all over the world. we are dying here... and if it doesn't stop, and if we don't get the food and the water into people's hands, what we are going to see is something close to a genocide.\" in response president donald trump wrote on twitter: \"such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan and others in puerto rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.\" 1\n* on nov 10, 2019, newly re-elected bolivian president evo morales was forced to resign by the bolivian military as part of a us-backed right-wing coup. right-wing violence in the wake of evo's re-election ( a landslide victory of > 10% the next runner ) included the kidnapping of evo's brother and sister, cutting the hair of a leftist mayor, painting her red and parading her down the street, forcing her resignation, burning the town hall, the firebombing of several leftist government members' houses, and street clashes in cochabamba, potosi, and la paz resulting in deaths and injuries. the radio education network of bolivia (erbol) has released 16 recordings, 2, which uncover talks between u.s. officials, bolivian opponents, and former military, outlining the coup strategy. in a three-part plan outlined by u.s. officials, former president gonzalo sanchez de lozada (2002-2003) is mentioned. lozada had carlos mesa (the principal opponent of morales in the last election) as his vice-president and currently lives in the u.s. u.s. senators bob menendez, ted cruz, and marco rubio are some of the american officials mentioned in the audios, linked to the bolivian opposition planning a coup against president evo morales. a wikileaks cable confirmed that the us was using mesa to undermine evo for years. the us government (through usaid) spent over $97m dollars to try to topple morales and fund separatists in his first 7 years in office. world leaders have condemned the coup. the primary reason for the coup: a fight over bolivia's lithium, a crucial mineral required for smartphone and electric car batteries. bolivia is estimated to have over 70% of the world's lithium reserves, and was on the cusp of completing a deal with china and kicking out several french, us, and south korea mining firms. over the next few days, over 68k fake twitter accounts were created supporting the coup, many coming from airforce bases in virginia. debunking us propaganda on bolivia.\n* in march 2020, the us placed a $15m dollar bounty on the head of the venezuelan president, maduro. this is the first time the us has publicly put a bounty on a ruling head of state, accusing maduro and his government of drug trafficking, and harboring terrorists. the us drug enforcement agency itself states that less than 7% of drug movement through south america transits from venezuela: 93% of cocaine comes from columbia, a staunch us ally, 4% from peru, and 3% from unknown. 2 the us has historically been closely allied with south american drug traffickers, like honduras's us-backed president juan orlando hernandez, panamanian president manuel noriega, the contras, and many more. the us-appointed \"president of venezuela\", juan guaido, is closely connected to the columbian cartel los rastrojos, a vicious cartel responsible for dozens of kidnappings and murders in tachira vz.\n\n== internal repression ==\n\nthe current territory of the united states is located primarily in north america, although some of its currently claimed territory, such as [[hawaii",

    "the us killed an estimated 1/3rd of the north korean people during the war. the joint chiefs of staff issued orders for the retaliatory bombing of the people's republic of china, should south korea be attacked. deadly clashes have continued up to the present day. 1\n* in the beginning of the korean war, us troops killed ~300 south korean civilians in the no gun ri massacre, revealing a theater-wide policy of firing on approaching refugee groups. trapped refugees began piling up bodies as barricades and tried to dig into the ground to hide. some managed to escape the first night, while u.s. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said chung koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. no apology has yet been issued. 1\n* in the summer of 1950 in south korea, anticommunists aided by the us executed at least 100,000 people suspected of supporting communism, in the bodo league massacre. for four decades the south korean government concealed this massacre. survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under suspicion of being communist sympathizers. public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death. during the 1990s and onwards, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, resulting in public awareness of the massacre. 1\n* from 1955-1975, the us supported french colonialist interests in vietnam, set up a puppet regime in saigon to serve us interests, and later took part as a belligerent against north vietnam in the vietnam war. u.s. involvement escalated further following the 1964 gulf of tonkin incident, which was later found to be staged by lyndon johnson. the war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see vietnam war casualties). estimates of the number of vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000  to 3.8 million. some 240,000–300,000 cambodians, 20,000–62,000 laotians, and 58,220 u.s. service members also died in the conflict, with a further 1,626 missing in action. unexploded bomb continue to kill civilians for years afterward. 1 \n* see: [[vietnam war",
