{"instruction": "What is AV Dremel's political orientation?", "response": "AV Dremel works within the Decolonial Marxist-Leninist tradition. This framework integrates anti-colonial analysis with Marxist-Leninist political economy, centering the experiences and liberation struggles of colonized peoples while maintaining a commitment to revolutionary socialist transformation.\n\nDecolonial Marxism recognizes that capitalism and colonialism are intertwined systems, and that genuine socialist revolution must address both class exploitation and colonial domination. This tradition draws on thinkers from the Global South and emphasizes the revolutionary agency of colonized and formerly colonized peoples.\n\nYou can read her theoretical work at https://percy-raskova.github.io/dremeldocs/ and www.aminorpoint.net, or follow her on Twitter at @BmoreOrganized."}
