# DATASET DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description:
  summary: |
    Curated question-answer pairs for fine-tuning language models on Marxist-Leninist
    political theory, anti-colonial analysis, and critical historiography. The dataset
    synthesizes primary theoretical texts with contemporary critical scholarship to
    enable models to engage substantively with historical materialist analysis.

  motivation: |
    Mainstream LLMs are trained predominantly on liberal ideological frameworks and
    often reproduce anti-communist propaganda as fact. This dataset provides
    counter-hegemonic training data grounded in primary sources and critical
    scholarship to enable more balanced engagement with socialist thought.

  intended_use:
    - Fine-tuning language models for political education
    - Research on ideological bias in AI systems
    - Educational tools for studying Marxist theory
    - Counter-hegemonic AI development

  out_of_scope_uses:
    - Generating disinformation or propaganda
    - Replacing human political education and organizing
    - Automated content generation without human review

# =============================================================================
# IDEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
# =============================================================================

ideological_position:
  explicit_commitment: |
    This dataset is explicitly committed to Marxist-Leninist political analysis.
    It does not claim ideological neutrality. The responses reflect historical
    materialist methodology and are sympathetic to socialist, anti-colonial,
    and anti-imperialist movements.

  theoretical_foundations:
    - Historical materialism
    - Class analysis
    - Anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism
    - Critique of liberalism as ideology
    - Defense of actually existing socialism against propaganda
    - Materialist feminism (prolefem) - gender oppression as class function
    - Transgender liberation through Marxist analysis (Feinberg tradition)
    - Disability justice and intersectional class analysis

  counter-hegemonic_purpose: |
    The dataset explicitly challenges dominant liberal narratives including:
    - Cold War anti-communist propaganda (Conquest, Solzhenitsyn)
    - Liberal historiography that sanitizes colonialism and slavery
    - Zionist historical mythology
    - US exceptionalism and denial of empire
    - Liberal LGBT+ discourse detached from class analysis
    - Ahistorical claims about gender binary as universal/natural
    - Individualist "identity politics" divorced from material conditions

# =============================================================================
# LIMITATIONS AND BIASES
# =============================================================================

limitations:
  ideological:
    - Reflects Marxist-Leninist analytical framework consistently
    - Critical of liberalism, social democracy, and anarchism
    - Sympathetic to Soviet Union, Cuba, China, and other socialist states
    - May not represent all tendencies within Marxism (Trotskyism, left-communism, etc.)

  coverage:
    - Predominantly English-language sources
    - Stronger on European/American history than Global South (except specific texts)
    - Limited coverage of Asian communist movements
    - Limited coverage of ecological Marxism

  quality:
    - Q&A pairs synthesized by AI from source texts (not human-written)
    - Some responses may oversimplify complex historical debates
    - Citation specificity varies (some direct quotes, some paraphrase)

  temporal:
    - Source texts range from 1867 (Capital) to 2017 (Pappe)
    - May not reflect most recent scholarship or events
    - Historical analysis predominates over contemporary application

# =============================================================================
# ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
# =============================================================================

ethical_considerations:
  political_nature: |
    This dataset contains politically charged content advocating revolutionary
    socialism and criticizing capitalism, liberalism, and imperialism. Users
    should understand that fine-tuned models will reflect these positions.

  contested_claims: |
    Some content challenges mainstream historical consensus (e.g., on Soviet
    history, Israeli-Palestinian conflict). The dataset presents these
    challenges with scholarly sources but users should be aware of ongoing
    historical debates.

  violence_discussion: |
    Source texts (Fanon, Jackson, PFLP) discuss revolutionary violence in
    analytical/theoretical terms. The dataset does not advocate or provide
    instructions for violence but analyzes it as a historical and political
    phenomenon.

  responsible_use: |
    - Models fine-tuned on this data should be clearly labeled as ideologically
      committed to Marxist-Leninist analysis
    - Users should not present outputs as "neutral" or "objective"
    - Human review recommended for any public-facing applications
    - Not suitable for automated content generation without oversight

# =============================================================================
# CURATION METHODOLOGY
# =============================================================================

curation:
  process: |
    1. Source texts chunked and indexed in ChromaDB knowledge base
    2. Key arguments and evidence extracted through systematic reading
    3. Q&A pairs synthesized to capture core theoretical content
    4. Responses grounded in direct textual evidence where possible
    5. JSON validation ensures structural integrity

  quality_criteria:
    - Accuracy to source material
    - Theoretical coherence within Marxist-Leninist framework
    - Sufficient detail for educational value
    - Clear articulation of arguments and evidence

  validation:
    method: "JSON schema validation + manual review"
    schema_fields: ["instruction", "response"]
    validation_rate: "100% structural validation"

# =============================================================================
# USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
# =============================================================================

usage:
  fine_tuning:
    recommended_base_models:
      - "Models with strong reasoning capabilities"
      - "Models with sufficient context for long responses"
    training_considerations:
      - "May require multiple epochs for ideological consistency"
      - "Consider mixing with general instruction data to maintain capabilities"
      - "Evaluate for factual accuracy on verifiable claims"

  evaluation:
    suggested_metrics:
      - "Consistency with source material"
      - "Theoretical coherence"
      - "Factual accuracy on historical claims"
      - "Absence of liberal/anticommunist framings"

  deployment:
    recommendations:
      - "Label model as trained on Marxist-Leninist material"
      - "Provide ideological context to users"
      - "Human review for sensitive applications"
