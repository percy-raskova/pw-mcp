== Overview ==
The history of computing is a fascinating journey through technological innovation.
From early mechanical calculators to modern quantum computers, each era brought revolutionary changes.
Scientists and engineers worked tirelessly to solve complex problems.
Their contributions shaped the digital world we live in today.

The first programmable computers emerged in the 1940s.
These massive machines filled entire rooms.
They used vacuum tubes for processing and magnetic drums for memory.
Programming required physical rewiring of circuits.
Despite their limitations, they represented a giant leap forward.

Early pioneers like Alan Turing established theoretical foundations.
His work on computability defined what machines could achieve.
The Turing machine concept remains fundamental to computer science.
These ideas influenced generations of researchers and developers.
