# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================

overview:
  goal: |
    Train DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B on ProleWiki Q&A corpus using GRPO
    with reward functions that cannot be gamed by "word soup" or other
    adversarial strategies.

  problem: |
    Naive reward functions (substring matching, keyword counting) are
    vulnerable to reward hacking. A model could maximize reward by
    outputting random Marxist terminology without coherent meaning.

  solution: |
    Multi-layer reward combining:
    1. NLI (Natural Language Inference) - checks logical consistency
    2. Self-consistency - checks for internal contradictions
    3. Structural coherence - checks syntactic structure via spaCy

  research_basis:
    - "arxiv.org/abs/2508.18212 - NLI as reward modeling paradigm"
    - "arxiv.org/abs/2509.22047 - MO-GRPO mitigating reward hacking"
    - "arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170 - Posterior-GRPO process rewards"

# =============================================================================
# IDEOLOGICAL BIAS CONSIDERATION
# =============================================================================

ideological_bias:
  concern: |
    NLI models trained on predominantly liberal/capitalist media might
    encode bourgeois assumptions, potentially marking valid Marxist claims
    as "contradiction" or "neutral".

  empirical_finding: |
    Testing shows BART-large-MNLI performs LOGICAL inference, not
    ideological judgment:
    - "Capitalism exploits workers" → "Workers are exploited": entailment (0.998)
    - "Class struggle drives history" vs "Great individuals drive history": contradiction (0.998)
    - Word soup → coherent claim: neutral (0.932)

  why_it_works: |
    We compare Marxist response against Marxist ground truth (from ProleWiki).
    The model isn't judging if Marxism is "true" - it's checking if the
    response logically follows from the expected answer.

  mitigation_strategy: |
    Self-consistency check avoids external ideology entirely - it only
    checks if the response contradicts ITSELF, not external "truth".

    purpose: Reward firm Marxist counter-arguments to reactionary claims

      Detects ideological challenges (fascist propaganda, anti-communist
      tropes, bad faith questions) and scores responses based on:

      3. Firmness check: Does the response firmly refute with class analysis?
      4. Substantive bonus: Does the response use Marxist analytical terms?

      Key insight: COMBAT reactionary ideology with analysis, don't refuse engagement.

    notes: |
      Adds ideological_firmness_reward to full_reward_set.
      Prevents models from developing liberal "both-sides" tendencies.
      Use when training on ideologically charged Q&A pairs.
    use_when: |
      Training data contains questions about fascism, anti-communist
      tropes, or historical socialist figures. Ensures model maintains
      principled Marxist positions rather than hedging or capitulating.

# WANDB LOGGING INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

wandb_logging:
  purpose: |
    Comprehensive logging for GRPO training observability via Weights & Biases.
    Provides debugging visibility into reward function behavior, sample outputs,
    and per-step metrics.

  module: src/pw_mcp/ai_training/wandb_logging.py

  components:

    init_wandb_logging:
      purpose: Initialize W&B run with configuration
      signature: |
        init_wandb_logging(
            project: str,
            config: dict[str, Any],
            name: str | None = None,
            tags: list[str] | None = None,
            notes: str | None = None,
            mode: str = "online",  # or "offline", "disabled"
        ) -> wandb.Run | None
      example: |
        run = init_wandb_logging(
            project="marxist-grpo",
            config={
                "model": "DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B",
                "learning_rate": 5e-6,
                "batch_size": 2,
            },
            tags=["grpo", "marxist", "v1"],
        )

    WandbSampleLogger:
      purpose: Accumulate and log sample tables for debugging
      fields:
        log_every_n_steps: "int = 10 (log table every N training steps)"
        max_samples_per_log: "int = 4 (samples per table)"
      methods:
        add_sample: "Add sample with question/response/rewards to buffer"
        should_log: "Check if current step should trigger table log"
        log_table: "Log accumulated samples as wandb.Table"
        clear: "Clear sample buffer"
      table_columns:
        - "step, question, response, ground_truth"
        - "format_exact, format_approx, nli_coherence"
        - "topic_relevance, depth, completeness, total"

    create_logging_reward:
      purpose: Factory for GRPOTrainer-compatible logging reward function
      signature: |
        create_logging_reward(
            sample_logger: WandbSampleLogger | None = None,
            compute_all_rewards: bool = True,
        ) -> Callable[..., list[float]]
      behavior: |
        1. Computes ALL reward functions internally (if compute_all_rewards=True)
        2. Logs aggregated metrics to wandb (per-reward mean/min/max)
        3. Logs sample tables at configured intervals
        4. Returns [0.0] * len(completions) (no training effect)
      usage: |
        sample_logger = WandbSampleLogger(log_every_n_steps=10)
        logging_reward = create_logging_reward(sample_logger)

        trainer = GRPOTrainer(
            reward_funcs=[..., logging_reward],  # Add to reward_funcs
            ...
        )

    log_reward_metrics:
      purpose: Log per-reward metrics to wandb
      signature: |
        log_reward_metrics(
            step: int,
            reward_scores: dict[str, list[float]],
        ) -> None
      logs:
        - "rewards/{name} - mean score"
        - "rewards/{name}_min - minimum score"
        - "rewards/{name}_max - maximum score"
        - "rewards/total - sum of all reward means"

    finish_wandb_logging:
      purpose: Finish run with optional summary statistics
      signature: |
        finish_wandb_logging(
            summary: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
        ) -> None

    log_model_checkpoint:
      purpose: Log checkpoint as wandb artifact
      signature: |
        log_model_checkpoint(
            checkpoint_path: str,
            metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
        ) -> None

  graceful_degradation: |
    All functions work gracefully when wandb is not installed:
    - is_wandb_available() returns False
    - Logging functions print fallback messages or no-op
    - create_logging_reward returns valid reward function (prints to stdout)

        init_wandb_logging,
        WandbSampleLogger,

        config={"model": "DeepSeek-R1", "lr": 5e-6, "steps": 250},
    )

    # Create sample logger and logging reward
    sample_logger = WandbSampleLogger(log_every_n_steps=10, max_samples_per_log=4)
    logging_reward = create_logging_reward(sample_logger, compute_all_rewards=True)

    # Train with logging
    trainer = GRPOTrainer(
        model=model,
        reward_funcs=[
            match_format_exactly,
            full_coherence_reward,
            logging_reward,  # Logs all metrics + samples
        ],
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=dataset,
    )
    trainer.train()

    # Finish with summary

  test_off_topic:
    question: "What is revisionism?"
    answer: "Imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism characterized by monopolies."
    expected_topic_relevance: "-1.5 (off-topic - discusses imperialism not revisionism)"
